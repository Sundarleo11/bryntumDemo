# Preventable events

## Preventing events

By returning `false` from a listener for an event documented as `preventable` the action that would otherwise be
executed after the event is prevented. These events names are usually prefixed with `before`.

**Sample code:**

```javascript
onBeforeEventEdit(event) {
    if (someCondition) {
       return false;
    } 
}
```
