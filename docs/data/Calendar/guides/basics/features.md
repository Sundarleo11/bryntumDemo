# Calendar features

Features are classes that add functionality to Calendar. The purpose of this guide is to give an overview of the
features
that ships with Calendar and show how you can configure them.

## Enabling/disabling and configuring features

Features are configured using Calendars [`features`](#Calendar/view/Calendar#config-features) config. Most features are enabled
by default, in which case you can disable them like this:
```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    features : {
        // Drag-create, drag-move and drag-resize disabled
        drag : false
    }
});
```

Others require you to enable them:
```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    features : {
        weekExpander : true
    }
});
```

Some features have configuration options (see the API docs for each feature for the options). In such cases you can
specify a configuration object instead of `true`:
```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    features : {
        externalEventSource : { // Configuration object
            // Element containing draggable items
            dragRootElement  : '#mySourceElementId',

            // Draggable item selector. innerText will be used as event name
            dragItemSelector : '.my-item-class'
        }
    }
});
```

If you need to access a feature at runtime, they are available through the `features` property on Calendar:

```javascript
calendar.features.eventEdit.editEvent(calendar.eventStore.first);
```

## Features in the box

Calendar itself has built-in core functionality for rendering resources & events, selection and keyboard navigation. On
top of that it ships with the features described below, some of which are enabled by default and some which you have to
enable manually.
