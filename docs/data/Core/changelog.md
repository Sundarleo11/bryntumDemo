# Bryntum Core version history

## 5.3.6 - 2023-05-26

### API CHANGES

* The `change` event for the `FieldFilterPickerGroup` now includes an additional property `validFilters`, the subset of
  filters that are complete and valid ([#6774](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6774))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6805](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6805) - `includeInSubset` creates duplicate records in the store
* [#6833](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6833) - Enabling/disabling filter checkbox in `FieldFilterPickerGroup` throws error on the console

## 5.3.5 - 2023-05-11

### BUG FIXES

* [#6384](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6384) - Inconsistent tool order in header of inline collapsed panel

## 5.3.4 - 2023-04-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Internal code improvements and bugfixes

## 5.3.3 - 2023-04-21

### BUG FIXES

* [#6166](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6166) - `createOnUnmatched` only creates new record on `Enter` key press

## 5.3.2 - 2023-04-04

### BUG FIXES

* [#6428](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6428) - `FullScreen.request` method should move `floatRoot` into the `fullscreened` element
* [#6433](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6433) - Escape key not working in example filter field

## 5.3.1 - 2023-03-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Tree store now applies filters/sorters to any new data when calling `applyChangeset()` ([#6155](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6155))

### API CHANGES

* Date parsing was made more forgiving in regard to character used to separate date parts. For example these strings are
  now all acceptable as `HH:mm`: `10:20`, `10 20`, `10-20`, `10/20` ([#6344](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6344))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6312](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6312) - Splitter does not move after updating to 5.3.0
* [#6328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6328) - `'move'` event `oldParent` should pass `rootNode` when moving a node from the `rootNode`

## 5.3.0 - 2023-03-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* There is a new `store` field type (`StoreDataField`) which can be used for fields on records that holds arrays. The
  array will be converted to a store, manipulating the store will flag the record as modified. On serialization the
  store will be converted back to an array
* Lots (but not all) of the not so informative `object` types in our TypeScript typings have been replaced with more
  specific types. Objects that in our JavaScript are used as maps are now declared as `Record<keyType, valueType>`, and
  for functions that accept object arguments many are replaced with anonymous type declarations, such as
  `{ foo: string, bar: number }` (Partially fixed [#5176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5176))
* `AjaxHelper.fetch` now supports using request body to pass parameters for non-GET requests. Please check
  `addQueryParamsToBody` argument in the method documentation ([#2855](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2855))
* The model relation system, a data layer concept used internally to link a `ResourceTimeRange` to a `Resource` in
  Scheduler, was made public. It allows you to define one-to-many relations between models in a `relations` block when
  subclassing `Model` ([#3222](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3222))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] `LocaleManager.registerLocale` and `LocaleManager.extendLocale` are deprecated.
  `LocaleHelper.publishLocale` should be used instead.
* [DEPRECATED] The type of the `fields` config for `FieldFilterPicker` and `FieldFilterPickerGroup` widgets has changed
  from array of `FieldOption`s to `Object` map of `FieldOption`s keyed by field name. The array type is now deprecated

### LOCALE UPDATES

* Locales format and process for applying locales have been simplified
* New locales for 31 languages have been added. Currently available languages are listed in the localization guide
  (Guides/Customization/Localization)

### BUG FIXES

* [#6212](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6212) - Infinite loop when chaining stores using `syncDataOnLoad`

## 5.2.10 - 2023-02-17

### API CHANGES

* Recently browsers have added support for Unicode 15, which changes the output of `Intl.DateTimeFormat` when
  formatting time to include `AM`/`PM`. Those browsers now use "thin space" (`\u202f`) instead of regular space. This
  affects the `DateHelper.format()` function, but likely you do not need to take any action in your application. It
  also affects `DateHelper.parse()`, which has been updated to support the new unicode space ([#6193](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6193))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5791](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5791) - `EventHelper`'s listeners for `.b-using-keyboard` break iOS dragging
* [#6039](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6039) - Resource order not applied with `syncDataOnLoad`
* [#6092](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6092) - Wrong type for `FetchOptions`
* [#6186](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6186) - Should be possible to get the previous parent in move event

## 5.2.9 - 2023-01-30

### BUG FIXES

* [#5526](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5526) - Cannot open second mask using static call
* [#6014](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6014) - Button menu listeners get duplicated when changing the menu
* [#6071](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6071) - DomHelper `getRootElement` throwing error on creating dependency

## 5.2.8 - 2023-01-19

### BUG FIXES

* [#5783](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5783) - Calendar dropdown getting focused when click on the label
* [#5821](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5821) - `constrainTo` not applied unless component is shown using `alignTo`
* [#5838](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5838) - Combo clearable trigger doesn't reset validation

## 5.2.5 - 2022-12-16

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Store now applies filters/sorters to any new data when calling `applyChangeset()` ([#5534](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5534))
* Added field `orderedParentIndex` to resolve position of the child in the ordered children array ([#5353](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5353))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5692](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5692) - Combos should be able to share Stores
* [#5730](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5730) - `index` is ignored when insert into filtered store
* [#5732](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5732) - Combo should update value collection silently when replacing store

* [#5587](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5587) - Do not patch `offsetX`/`offsetY`

## 5.2.2 - 2022-11-08

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The behaviour of the `store.data` getter will be changed in 6.0. Currently, it returns the **initial**
  raw dataset, in 6.0 it will be changed to have the more expected behaviour of returning the data objects for the
  **current** state instead ([#5499](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5499))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5491](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5491) - `onToolClick` not working correctly (even with `callOnFunctions: true`)

## 5.2.1 - 2022-10-28

### API CHANGES

* `TreeNode.isRoot` property is now public ([#5471](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5471))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5451](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5451) - `DatePicker` animation glitch
* [#5480](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5480) - `EventHelper` has globally visible breaking side effects

## 5.2.0 - 2022-10-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The responsive state objects used in the `responsive` config of the `Responsive` mixin now support a `once` property
  to allow configs to only be set on first activation of the state
* The `Core.helper.DateHelper` class has a new method `formatRange` method which can format date ranges, as well as new
  formatting options for week numbers
* Added new `FieldFilterPicker` and `FieldFilterPickerGroup` widgets, providing UI to manage a set of CollectionFilters

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `DomHelper.up()` function was deprecated, use native `element.closest()` instead

### BUG FIXES

* [#2512](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2512) - Implement `ignoreParentReadOnly` config on `Widget`

## 5.1.5 - 2022-10-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* New records are assigned a generated `id` if none is provided. The generated `id` is meant to be temporary (a
  phantom `id`), and should be replaced by the backend on commit. Previously the `id` was based on a global counter
  incremented with each assignment. That simplistic scheme assured no two records got the same `id` during a session,
  but if an application serialized the generated `id` (note, they should not) and then reloaded it, it would eventually
  collide with a new generated `id`. To prevent this, the generated `id`s are now based on a random UUID instead
* Stores now by default show a warning on console when loading records that has generated `id`s, as a reminder that it
  should be replaced by the backend on commit

### BUG FIXES

* [#4645](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4645) - Improve error message "Bryntum bundle included twice"
* [#5341](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5341) - `Picker` is shown for `Combo` with `keyStrokeFilterDelay` after clearing value

## 5.1.4 - 2022-09-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* FilterBar feature now allows you to configure `operator` and `caseSensitive` on a column's `filterable` config object

### BUG FIXES

* [#4974](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4974) - `AjaxStore` continuously making remote requests after store grouping when `sortParamName` is set
* [#5213](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5213) - `DatePicker` can't move months if min date is after current date
* [#5214](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5214) - `AjaxStore` continuously making remote requests after store sorting with `syncDataOnLoad` set to `true`
* [#5282](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5282) - Make `AjaxStore` urls changeable

## 5.1.3 - 2022-09-09

### BUG FIXES

* [#415](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/415) - Improve docs on formatting currency values on `NumberField`
* [#5125](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5125) - Setting an initial value for `activeTab` on a `TabPanel` no longer animates that tab into view
* [#5136](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5136) - `callOnFunctions: true` triggers an error when on function is not set
* [#5182](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5182) - `TimeField` should keep date if user types in the value
* [#5201](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5201) - `Store` sort uses `localeCompare` for non-string types

## 5.1.2 - 2022-08-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Configs that accept configuration options for a widget (or other class) are now (mostly) documented to accept a typed
  config object rather than a plain object. For example instead of `{Object} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`,
  it is now `{TooltipConfig} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`. This improves our TypeScript typings (transforms
  to `Partial<TooltipConfig>` in typings) when using such configs, but also improves our docs by linking to the configs
  of the type
* Added a `keepDate` config to the `TimeField`. By default, it is false and sets date component of the field value to
  `January 1st`. Set it to true to keep original value intact and only change the time component ([#5058](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5058))
* Excel export feature now accepts a `rows` array to export only certain rows instead of the full dataset

### BUG FIXES

* [#4953](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4953) - `List` component does not process the disabled config
* [#5088](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5088) - Crash when entering number into paging toolbar `page` field

## 5.1.1 - 2022-07-28

### BUG FIXES

* [#4958](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4958) - List store reload needs to reset selection if no incoming records match previous selection

## 5.1.0 - 2022-07-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Updated the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to `6.1.1`
* Our TypeScript typings for string types that have a predefined set of alternatives was improved to only accept
  those alternatives. For example previously the `dock` config which was previously declared as `dock: string` is now
  `dock : 'top'|'right'|'bottom'|'left'`
* `KeyMap` is a mixin that allows for standardized and customizable keyboard shortcuts functionality. `KeyMap` is by
  default mixed in to `Widget` and therefore available to all `Widget`'s child classes. There is a new guide
  **Guides/Customization/Keyboard shortcuts** describing how to customize currently integrated keyboard shortcuts
  ([#4300](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4300), [#4313](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4313), [#4328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4328))

* [#4657](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4657) - Cannot navigate out of the datetime field using `Shift + Tab`

## 5.0.4 - 2022-05-11

### API CHANGES

* Container's `autoUpdateRecord` config was made public. Set it to `true` to update record fields when child fields
  change ([#4073](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4073))
* Model's `clearChanges` function parameter `includeDescendants` made public. Set it to `false` to not clear changes on
  a node's descendants ([#4565](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4565))

## 5.0.0 - 2022-02-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `Model` has a new `readOnly` field that is respected by UI level editing features to disallow editing records having
  `readOnly : true`. It does not directly affect the datalayer, meaning that you can still programmatically edit the
  records ([#665](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/665))
* New `Radio` and `RadioGroup` widgets were added ([#1357](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1357))

  environments ([#4071](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4071))

  https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&c=charts-diagrams&s=solid

### API CHANGES

  widget was added which is used in Gantt's NotesTab
* [BREAKING] TextAreaPickerField's `inline` config has been removed, use TextAreaField instead

* Config `Button#menuIconCls` - previously replaced by `menuIcon` config
* Config `Tooltip.html` no longer handles returning `false` as a way of flagging the tooltip content as async -
      previously replaced by the `showAsyncMessage` config
* Param `record` of the `Store#move` event - previously replaced with the `records` param
* Old `TreeNode#insertChild()` signature - previously replaced with current `(childRecord, before, silent)` 
      signature
* Argument `returnAll` for `DomHelper.createElement` - previously replaced by `options.returnAll`

## 4.1.0 - 2021-04-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* API code improvements for better XSS injection protection
* Model fields can now be marked with `alwaysWrite` to ensure important data fields are always included when updates
* Refactored `TabPanel` base class to `Panel` from `Container`. The `Panel` class's algorithm for handling docked
  items (such as `tbar` and `bbar`) was enhanced to work with the new `tabBar` config of `TabPanel` using the new
  `strips` config. The `strips` config is like `tools` except it is designed for toolbars. The items in `strips`
  have a `dock` config to specify the edge to which they dock (`'top'`, `'left'`, `'bottom'`, or `'right'`) or,
  alternatively, `'header'` or `'pre-header'` to position the toolbar in the panel's header after or before the
  title, respectively. These items also use their `weight` config to determine their docking order. The higher the
  item's `weight`, the closer it will be to the panel's central body element ([#1837](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1837))
* Refactored the tab strip of `TabPanel` into a `TabBar` widget that extends `Toolbar`. This uses the new `tabBar`
  config of `TabPanel` to add an item to the new `strips` config of `Panel`. The `tabBar` uses its `weight` config
  to order it along with `tbar` and `bbar` of the `Panel`. The `tabBar` also inherits the `overflow` feature of
  `Toolbar` ([#1827](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1827))
* Panel now has a `bodyCls` config to place CSS classes on the body element
* DatePicker now supports `cellRenderer` to output custom contents into the date cells ([#2498](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2498))

### BUG FIXES

* [#876](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/876) - `store.query` should search through all records when searchAllRecords is true
* [#1819](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1819) - DatePicker styling issues
* [#2128](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2128) - Support for top-positioned field labels
* [#2194](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2194) - Setting `title` on item in a `TabPanel` now updates the text of the tab in the tab bar
* [#2235](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2235) - Not possible to type in negative numbers to the number field
* [#2273](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2273) - Toast shows blank space at right side
* [#2317](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2317) - Date picker jumps to wrong month when clicking next

* [#1729](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1729) - Added border color for disabled button

## 4.0.0 - 2020-10-19

### API CHANGES

* Mask `progress` and `maxProgress` are now public properties
* The `Core/adapter` directory has been removed. There are no Widget adapters. All Widget classes register themselves
  with the `Widget` class, and the `Widget` class is the source of Widget `type` mapping and Widget registration and
  lookup by `id`
* Toolbars now have an inner element to wrap their child items with the class `'b-toolbar-content'`
  If you had customized CSS which targeted toolbar items, this may need to change

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* Added new 'filterfield' to filter a Store
* Added new class `Core.helper.XMLHelper` with method to convert object to XML format
* Added XSS protection functions: `StringHelper.encodeHtml` and `StringHelper.xss`
* The `Toolbar` class now has an `overflow` config which may be `scroll` or `menu` to specify how overflowing toolbar
  items can be accessed

### BUG FIXES

* [#1349](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1349) - Not possible to type into field with text selected
* [#1483](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1483) - Fixed time format with AM/PM removing the "0" changing from 09:00 PM to 9:00 PM

* [#1694](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1694) - Label overlaps start trigger in material theme
* [#1779](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1779) - Label overlaps trigger icon in DateTimeField if value is empty

## 3.0.2 - 2020-01-29

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* The core.module.js bundle is now lightly transpiled to ECMAScript 2015 using Babel to work with more browsers out of
  the box
* parentIndex is now a public field of TreeNode ([#358](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/358))
* Font Awesome 5 Pro was replaced with Font Awesome 5 Free as the default icon font (MIT / SIL OFL license)
* Font Awesome should be bound to font-weight 900 ([#596](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/596))
* The default year for our time components has been changed, they now use 2020 instead of 1970. For example,
  whatever time you set to the TimeField, the date will be Jan 1, 2020
* All widgets which contain other widgets can now be set to `readOnly : true` in addition to Field widgets
  This means it is easy to "lock" a UI to allow it to display information to users who may not have authorization
  to modify data
* The `Widget` `align` config's object form now accepts the `monitorResize` option, specifying that during
  aligned visibility, the Widget should monitor its target's size, and realign if it changes
* The `StateTrackingManager` now fires a new `disabled` event indicating its disabled state

### API CHANGES

* ObjectHelper#setPath method became chainable: it returns passed object instance
* DateHelper.getTime now accepts date as a parameter to extract time of
* Added DateHelper.defaultParseFormat property to allow separate formats for date/time parsing and formatting
* Model#copy now accepts an object with new values used to create the copy
* DEPRECATED: Model#copy no longer accepts passing `deep` property of the first parameter. Use 2nd parameter to indicate
  deep copying instead
* Removed not used localizations `DateHelper.shortWeek`, `DateHelper.shortQuarter`, `DateHelper.week`,
  `InstancePlugin.fnMissing`, `InstancePlugin.overrideFnMissing`
* Added `Model.clearChanges` method to clear record modifications without reverting them
* Added `DateHelper.getWeekNumber` method to get week number by date
* Model fields in derived classes are now merged with corresponding model fields (by name) in super classes. This allows
  serialization and other attributes to be inherited when a derived class only wants to change the `defaultValue` or
  other attribute of the field
* The `dateFormat` config for `type='date'` model fields has been simplified to `format`

### BUG FIXES

* [#742](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/742) - Not persistable data change may initiate a commit with an empty object
* [#756](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/756) - Cannot copy task when using deep: true flag
* [#330](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/330) - Id collision happens when you add or move records after filters are cleared
* [#422](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/422) - Theme switching leaks elements and crashes if changing multiple times with slow network
* [#492](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/492) - Button pressed/hover state sticks after click
* [#501](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/501) - DateHelper can't parse time with milliseconds correctly
* [#719](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/719) - Direction of sorting gets changed after each sort call with a sorting function provided
* [#729](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/729) - Field validation messages should be localizable
* [#769](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/769) - Popup is not aligned to target properly with constrainTo
* [#872](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/872) - Card layout Containers (eg `TabPanel`) now use the Widget `hide`/`show` API to hide and show child items
  meaning that apps can detect and react to these lifecycle events
* [#975](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/975) - STM doesn't update store changes properly
* [#1393](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1393) - Combo's field overwritten during type-to-filter

## 3.0.1 - 2020-01-16

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* Store can now remove individual filters by filter id or Filter instance using `store.removeFilter` ([#462](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/462))

### BUG FIXES

* [#2](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2) - Not possible to enter 00:00 into time field
* [#213](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/213) - The `FilePicker` would fire two `change` events on each file selection. IE11 and Edge would also not
  fire the `change` event correctly, often not firing on the first user selection. Both issues have been corrected
* [#253](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/253) - Fixed exception when a popup (such as a context menu) would lose focus due to an active editor's
  `invalidAction: 'block'` setting. Such editors return focus to themselves when invalid, causing the popup to hide
  itself in the middle of its `show()` call
* [#258](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/258) - CheckBox should be usable as a field

## 3.0.0 - 2019-12-20

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* Added `leadingZeroes` config option for NumberField (#7524)
* Localization. Common localizable words and phrases may now be added to a common `Object` block of properties and will
  be accessible to all classes
* Added support for named listeners ([#43](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/43))

### API CHANGES

* BREAKING: Model no longer considers `null` as a valid id on records. It is now handled the same way as if id was
  undefined, meaning that a generated id will be assigned instead. If you use `null` as id on a record in your code,
  this change might be breaking

  We recommend to always supply an id for records from your backend, and there is a new setting on Store to enforce
  that. Configuring Store with `allowNoId: false` will make it throw if a record without id is loaded (#8570)
* `Mask` now accepts a `target` config instead of an `element` config. The constructor converts an `element` in the
  config object to the new `target` config, but passing `element` is now deprecated
* BREAKING: The `element` property of a `Mask` instance is now the mask's primary element (as with widgets). This
  could break applications if they were to access this property and expect to have the mask's target (which is now
  accessed via the mask's `target` property)
* NumberField no longer uses native stepping with the arrow keys, instead it implements its own with configurable
  behaviour. See the new `changeOnSpin` config
* `DomHelper.createElement()` now accepts options as an object for its 2nd parameter. If a `Boolean`
  is passed, it is still interpreted as the `returnAll` parameter

  To pass `returnAll` in the new form: `createElement(..., { returnAll: true });`

### BUG FIXES

* #9212 - Adding FilePicker as widget for column
