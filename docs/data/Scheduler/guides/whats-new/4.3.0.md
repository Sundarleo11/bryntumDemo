# What's new in Scheduler v4.3.0

## Changes to TimeAxisColumn

TimeAxisColumn now subclasses WidgetColumn (before it was a Column), this should not affect your code. This opens up
for rendering widgets embedded in row cells, see this demonstrated in the new
[embedded-chart](https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/examples/embedded-chart/) demo in Scheduler Pro.
