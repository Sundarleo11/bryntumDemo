* `ResourceTimeRanges` can now be recurring out of the box, without the need for mixing in recurrence support on the
  store and model classes ([#6611](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6611))
* [ANGULAR] Bryntum Scheduler now ships with two npm Angular wrapper packages to support different versions of Angular
  framework. Existing `@bryntum/scheduler-angular` package is now designed to work with Angular 12 and newer versions,
  which use the IVY rendering engine. New `@bryntum/scheduler-angular-view` package is designed to work with Angular 11
  and older versions, which use the View Engine rendering. Check Upgrading and Angular integration guides in
  documentation for more information ([#6270](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6270))
* [ANGULAR] `angular-11-routing` demo has been upgraded to show use of `@bryntum/scheduler-angular-view` package with

* [ANGULAR] legacy `angular-6`, `angular-7` and `angular-8` demos has been removed

### API CHANGES

* Time axis filters that produce an empty timeline are now temporarily disabled while you zoom. Filters should ideally
  check the `scheduler.timeaxis.unit` property to only apply it to relevant zoom levels

* [#6593](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6593) - Toggling `EventResize` disabled state does not show resize handles

## 5.3.2 - 2023-04-04

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [REACT] Added new TypeScript demo "Drag from Grid". Demo is located in
  `examples/frameworks/react/typescript/drag-from-grid` ([#4891](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4891))
* The `crudmanager` demo was updated to use a more extensive PHP + MySQL backend, based on the backend from the `php`
  demo in Gantt

### API CHANGES

## 5.3.1 - 2023-03-17

### API CHANGES

* `ProjectModel` convenience getter methods (`events`, `resources` etc) now returns `allRecords` instead of `records`
* Date parsing was made more forgiving in regard to character used to separate date parts. For example these strings are
  now all acceptable as `HH:mm`: `10:20`, `10 20`, `10-20`, `10/20` ([#6344](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6344))

### BUG FIXES

## 5.3.0 - 2023-03-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The CSS used to support `eventStyle` and `eventColor` was changed, reducing the size of the unminified Scheduler
  specific CSS from just below 500kB down to 110kB, while also making it easier for us to add more colors and styles
  in the future
* Support for Time zone conversion has been added to all Bryntum scheduling products. Simply set a IANA time zone
  identifier as value for the `timeZone` config and that's it. But, since time zones is not supported natively in
  JavaScript we strongly recommend to read our Time zone guide ([#1533](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1533))
* Scheduler now does less processing of already visible events when scrolling, boosting scroll performance with large
  number of events on screen simultaneously ([#5651](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5651))
* Localization demos updated to show up-to-date localization approach
* `AjaxHelper.fetch` now supports using request body to pass parameters for non-GET requests. Please check
  `addQueryParamsToBody` argument in the method documentation ([#2855](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2855))
* Vertical mode now supports grouping resources ([#1395](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1395))
* [REACT] React components can now be used in event renderers ([#763](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/763))
* [REACT] New example that shows how to use React components in event renderers. Demo is localed in
  `examples/frameworks/react/javascript/react-events` folder.
* Lots (but not all) of the not so informative `object` types in our TypeScript typings have been replaced with more
  specific types. Objects that in our JavaScript are used as maps are now declared as `Record<keyType, valueType>`, and
  for functions that accept object arguments many are replaced with anonymous type declarations, such as
  `{ foo: string, bar: number }` (Partially fixed [#5176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5176))
* Tooltips in the `react-tooltips` demo are now rich, with resource avatar and event times ([#6184](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6184))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] `LocaleManager.registerLocale` and `LocaleManager.extendLocale` are deprecated.
  `LocaleHelper.publishLocale` should be used instead.
* [BREAKING] The `syncEventRecord()` function of the `RecurrenceEditor` was made private, it was unintentionally public
  before and there is no reason to use it directly.
* When configuring a Scheduler with a time zone at initialization, and there's also a `startDate` and/or a `endDate`
  initially, those days will be treated as in local system time zone and will therefore be converted to the configured
  time zone. Previously (in `5.3.0-alpha-1` and `5.3.0-beta-1`) those dates was treated as in the provided time zone

### LOCALE UPDATES

* Locales format and process for applying locales have been simplified
* New locales for 31 languages have been added. Currently available languages are listed in the localization guide
  (Guides/Customization/Localization)

### BUG FIXES

* [#5856](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5856) - `Intl.supportedValuesOf` fallback in time zone demos
* [#5889](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5889) - Events are not rendered according to the timezone when scheduler has a timezone
* [#5968](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5968) - Scroll To Date In RTL not working correctly
* [#5986](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5986) - `eventStyle: 'line'` broken

* [#6217](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6217) - `toggleNode` event doesn't get triggered for parent with `children : true`
* [#6234](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6234) - Event bar disappears on drop with filtered timeaxis, `snapRelativeToEventStart` & `fillTicks`
* [#6250](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6250) - `showCurrentTimeLine` not working on filtered timeaxis
* [#6260](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6260) - Milestone is rendered incorrectly

## 5.2.10 - 2023-02-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `beforeSend` event triggered by `CrudManager` now allows async listeners ([#6011](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6011))

### API CHANGES

* Recently browsers have added support for Unicode 15, which changes the output of `Intl.DateTimeFormat` when
  formatting time to include `AM`/`PM`. Those browsers now use "thin space" (`\u202f`) instead of regular space. This
  affects the `DateHelper.format()` function, but likely you do not need to take any action in your application. It
  also affects `DateHelper.parse()`, which has been updated to support the new unicode space ([#6193](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6193))
* [DEPRECATED] The `eventRecord` and `assignmentRecord` params of the `eventKeyDown` & `eventKeyUp` events fired by
  Scheduler were renamed to `eventRecords` and `assignmentRecords` to match the type (array)

### BUG FIXES

* [#5977](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5977) - Chained `resourceStore` doesn't work as expected
* [#6027](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6027) - `eventKeyUp` and `eventKeyDown` not being triggered correctly

## 5.2.9 - 2023-01-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The event editor of the `EventEdit` feature may be reconfigured to not be a popup by configuring the `editorConfig`
  with `floating : false` or by adding an `appendTo` config. In this situation, the editor is displayed as a side-docked
  overlay. See the new docked-editor example ([#5873](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5873))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5006](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5006) - Add `ViewPreset` base property to documentation and TS types
* [#5956](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5956) - `ResizeObserver` loop limit exceeded warning
* [#5971](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5971) - Dependency terminals not shown when enabling feature at runtime

## 5.2.7 - 2023-01-11

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `EventDrag` feature's events `beforeEventDrag` and `eventDragStart` property `event` will be replaced
  by `domEvent` in 6.0. This to make it more clear that it refers to the original event from the `DOM` that initiated
  the Bryntum event ([#5818](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5818))
* [DEPRECATED] The `handleSize` and `touchHandleSize` configs to the `EventResize` feature is deprecated and will no
  longer have any effect. The handle size is determined from the theme's CSS ([#5882](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5882))

### BUG FIXES

* [#2258](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2258) - Dragged task hangs on drop position when drag and drop is finalized in `beforeEventDropFinalize` handler
* [#3995](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3995) - Using chained `eventStore` caused an error

## 5.2.6 - 2022-12-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [REACT] React wrapper now supports React components in widgets and tooltips ([#774](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/774))
* Dependencies feature now fires `dependencyContextMenu` event when right clicking a dependency line ([#5800](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5800))

### BUG FIXES

* [#4455](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4455) - Copy-paste event to collapsed group should be a no-op
* [#4569](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4569) - Row outlined after event copy paste
* [#5486](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5486) - Horizontal scrollbar overlaps when the view becomes smaller

* [#5830](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5830) - "No records to display" label is wrongly rendered

## 5.2.5 - 2022-12-16

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler previously supported including milestone labels in the layout calculations to avoid overlap in a mode that
  "stretches" the diamonds (by configuring a `milestoneLayoutMode`). It can now do the same for the normal milestone
  rendition by combining  `milestoneLayoutMode` with the new `milestoneTextPosition : 'always-outside'` setting. The
  `milestonelayout` demo was updated to showcase this ([#3483](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3483))
* `RowCopyPaste` feature supports copying rows in a tree. Copied records will have same hierarchy
* Paste after cut and copy behavior is unified, records are moved below the paste target
* Event drag feature is improved to allow copying dragged event. To copy, press and hold copy key (`Shift` by
  default). Copy can either add new assignment (default) or copy the event itself, this behavior is controlled
  by `copyMode` config. ([#4940](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4940))
* The `Dependencies` feature has a new `clickWidth` config, that lets you enlarge the clickable area for dependency
  lines. Tradeoff being that the lines will be more expensive to draw. The `dependencies` demo has been updated
  with a slider for adjusting it ([#41](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/41))

### BUG FIXES

## 5.2.4 - 2022-11-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We recently launched a new homepage over at [bryntum.com](https://bryntum.com), and have now slightly updated the
  styling for demos and docs to better match it (new logo, new header color, new font). Please note that this is not a
  change to our themes, only the look of the demos, and it won't affect your application

### BUG FIXES

* [#4463](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4463) - Event drag create on big dataset generates error
* [#5307](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5307) - [React] error when changing Scheduler dataset in React Advanced demo
* [#5541](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5541) - Timeline header is not rendered when calling `zoomToFit`
* [#5595](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5595) - Fix panel collapse icon directions
* [#5633](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5633) – Crash when changing bar margin slider in demo

## 5.2.3 - 2022-11-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `Dependencies` feature has a new `drawOnScroll` config, that controls whether dependencies are dawn during scroll
  or only when scrolling ends. Setting it to `false` will boost scrolling performance for schedules with many
  dependencies ([#5555](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5555))
* Pan and EventDragSelect features now offer preventable `beforePan` and `beforeEventDragSelect` events which give you
  better control over when each feature is active.
* The `EventModel.split` function can now accept a duration to split at in the form of a string such as `'30 min'`. The
  duration of the event will be converted into the specified units if they are different. The new event's duration will
  be in the same units. Splitting using a fraction of the event duration will continue to work as usual.

### BUG FIXES

* [#4868](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4868) - Events UI does not update when using batch mode and update custom field
* [#5535](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5535) - Inconsistent End Date information in event tooltip when zooming out
* [#5551](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5551) - Store `allRecords` includes group footers twice
* [#5578](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5578) - [LWC] `onScheduleScroll` listener should be disabled for Salesforce

## 5.2.2 - 2022-11-08

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The behaviour of the `store.data` getter will be changed in 6.0. Currently, it returns the **initial**
  raw dataset, in 6.0 it will be changed to have the more expected behaviour of returning the data objects for the
  **current** state instead. See Grid's upgrade guide for more information ([#5499](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5499))

### BUG FIXES

* [#3600](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3600) - Hide resize handle if disabled on feature level
* [#5500](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5500) - `eventResizeEnd` doesn't return the resized `eventRecord`
* [#5520](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5520) - [LWC] Scheduler throws on body scroll if pan feature is active

## 5.2.1 - 2022-10-28

### BUG FIXES

* [#1996](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1996) - Maximum call stack size exceeded when updating event `resourceId`
* [#4443](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4443) - `MergeCells` set `true` resources are not collapsing correctly
* [#5149](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5149) - Angular demos now use component-local styles using `ViewEncapsulation.None`
* [#5377](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5377) - `hideHeaders` crashing vertical mode when combined with `FilterBar` feature

* [#5465](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5465) - `EventStore.filter()` does not trigger refresh

## 5.2.0 - 2022-10-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* A new widget, `ViewPresetCombo`, is available to Scheduler, SchedulerPro and Gantt. Put it in the toolbar, and it will
  provide easy-to-setup view switching. It uses the built-in `ViewPreset`s functionality which is easily customized
  ([#4539](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4539))
* New `booking` demo, mimicking a real property booking interface
* ResourceTimeRanges feature now has a `enableMouseEvents` flag which lets you interact with the resource time range
  elements ([#1069](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1069))
* The `TimeRanges` feature was refactored to support virtualization, it now only renders lines and ranges in view. This
  also applies to the `NonWorkingTime` feature, and will boost rendering performance on long time axes when either
  feature is used ([#3757](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3757))
* Added a new `collapsible-columns` demo showing how to use collapsible column groups ([#4878](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4878))
* You can now select a custom time span in the timeline header, see new `time-selection` demo ([#2676](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2676))
* The `NonWorkingTime` feature was made aware of the `fillTicks` config, cropping the non-working-time ranges for a
  better look when `fillTicks` is enabled
* A new `EventNonWorkingTime` feature was added. When enabled, the parts of the event bars that intersect weekends will
  be shaded. Can be tried in the updated `nonworkingdays` demo ([#5150](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5150))
* Menu has a `separator` config to make it easier to visually separate menu items
* The responsive state objects used in the `responsive` config of the `Responsive` mixin now support a `once` property
  to allow configs to only be set on first activation of the state
* The `Core.helper.DateHelper` class has a new method `formatRange` method which can format date ranges, as well as new
  formatting options for week numbers
* The `TreeGroup` feature introduced in 5.0.0 has been reworked and now also works in Scheduler. Check it out in the new
  `tree-grouping` demo
* PdfExport feature is refactored to render content directly. This significantly improves performance and robustness by
  eliminating component scrolling. This behavior is enabled by default. You can revert to the old behavior by setting
  `enableDirectRendering` config on the export feature to `false`. ([#4449](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4449))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `highlightWeekends` config of the `NonWorkingTime` feature is superfluous, disabling the feature will
  yield the same result. It has been deprecated and will be removed in 6.0

## 5.1.5 - 2022-10-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* New records are assigned a generated `id` if none is provided. The generated `id` is meant to be temporary (a
  phantom `id`), and should be replaced by the backend on commit. Previously the `id` was based on a global counter
  incremented with each assignment. That simplistic scheme assured no two records got the same `id` during a session,
  but if an application serialized the generated `id` (note, they should not) and then reloaded it, it would eventually
  collide with a new generated `id`. To prevent this, the generated `id`s are now based on a random UUID instead
* Stores now by default show a warning on console when loading records that has generated `id`s, as a reminder that it
  should be replaced by the backend on commit

### BUG FIXES

* [#4645](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4645) - Improve error message "Bryntum bundle included twice"
* [#4654](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4654) - [REACT] Bryntum widget wrappers don't accept all component properties in React 18

## 5.1.4 - 2022-09-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `ScheduleContext` feature now offers a `triggeredBy` config which may be `'mouseover'`. It also offers
  a `renderer` which allows applications to customize the highlight style. Scheduler now fires a `timelineContextChange`
  event when the mouse moves from tick to tick and row to row within the schedule region. ([#5035](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5035))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `events` config of `SchedulerDatePicker` has been renamed to `showEvents`. The `events` property is
  deprecated but will continue to work during its deprecation period
* [DEPRECATED] The 3rd param of the `scrollResourceEventIntoView` was deprecated and will be removed in a future release
* [DEPRECATED] The 2nd param of the `scrollAssignmentIntoView` was deprecated and will be removed in a future release

### BUG FIXES

* [#3198](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3198) - Order of events changes on scrolling if `eventLayout: 'none'`
* [#4374](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4374) - Console error if return false on preventable `beforeAdd` event on dependency store
* [#4995](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4995) - Should not allow creating or dragging events for `readOnly` resources

* [#5170](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5170) - When first region has width and last region is collapsed, Scheduler doesn't resize with container
* [#5231](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5231) - `eventDragSelect` does not select events when scrolling
* [#5272](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5272) - Group Summary not updating when display in header
* [#5315](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5315) - Scheduler has no vertical lines in vertical mode
* [#5316](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5316) - `AvatarRendering` should always set alt text by default

## 5.1.3 - 2022-09-09

### BUG FIXES

* [#415](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/415) - Improve docs on formatting currency values on `NumberField`
* [#3680](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3680) - Support Salesforce Winter 22 release
* [#5062](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5062) - Drag from grid demo is missing invalid indicator

* [#5135](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5135) - Event is not selected after `Ctrl + click` following a multi-drag

## 5.1.2 - 2022-08-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Configs that accept configuration options for a widget (or other class) are now (mostly) documented to accept a typed
  config object rather than a plain object. For example instead of `{Object} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`,
  it is now `{TooltipConfig} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`. This improves our TypeScript typings (transforms
  to `Partial<TooltipConfig>` in typings) when using such configs, but also improves our docs by linking to the configs
  of the type
* Added a config to allow State Tracking Manager to ignore remote changes coming in a sync response. This allows user
  to only undo/redo local changes (`ignoreRemoteChangesInSTM` config on the ProjectModel/CrudManager) ([#5083](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5083))

### BUG FIXES

* [#2124](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2124) - UI issues related to recurring events

## 5.1.1 - 2022-07-28

### BUG FIXES

* [#4637](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4637) - `mergeCells` is not reactive to row height
* [#4849](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4849) - Scheduler Pro with dependencies | Vertical mode + Resize
* [#4908](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4908) - Collapsing resource tree column changes dependency lines
* [#4957](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4957) - `ScheduleContext` feature does not offer information about the selected context

## 5.1.0 - 2022-07-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `Dependencies` feature was refactored, it now supports vertical mode (shown in the new vertical-dependencies demo)
  and also continuously redraws dependencies during drag, resize and transitions. In addition to this it now also allows
  customizing the marker (arrow head), applying a radius to line corners for a more rounded look and taking full control
  over what enters the DOM using a `renderer` function ([#4579](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4579))
* Scheduler `ResourceModel` now has a `columnWidth` field which is used in vertical mode ([#734](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/734))
* Our TypeScript typings for string types that have a predefined set of alternatives was improved to only accept
  those alternatives. For example previously the `dock` config which was previously declared as `dock: string` is now
  `dock : 'top'|'right'|'bottom'|'left'`
* Create React App templates now available
* Configuring the CrudManager was made a little easier by introducing shortcuts for setting load and sync urls using the
  new `loadUrl` and `syncUrl` configs
* Updated the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to `6.1.1`
* `KeyMap` is a mixin that allows for standardized and customizable keyboard shortcuts functionality. `KeyMap` is by
  default  mixed in to `Widget` and therefore available to all `Widget`'s child classes. There is a new guide
  **Guides/Customization/Keyboard shortcuts** describing how to customize currently integrated keyboard shortcuts
  ([#4300](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4300), [#4313](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4313), [#4328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4328))
* CrudManager uses `parentIndex` field to insert record to the correct position in the store ([#4720](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4720))
* CrudManager optionally allows `sync()` calls without local changes, to retrieve changes from the backend. Configure
  `forceSync : true` to enable this new behaviour ([#4575](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4575))
* The dependency hover tooltip can now be configured using the new `tooltipTemplate` config on the Dependencies feature
  ([#1063](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1063))
* The tooltip shown while creating new dependencies can now be configured using the new `creationTooltipTemplate` config
  on the Dependencies feature ([#4655](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4655))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] [ANGULAR] Angular wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd
  bundle. Hence application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and
  performance ([#2786](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2786))
* [BREAKING] `schedulerpro.lite.umd.js` bundle is no longer available
* [BREAKING] WebComponents has been removed from `scheduler.module.js` ES modules bundle. New bundle with WebComponents
  is `scheduler.wc.module.js`
* [BREAKING] The `draw()`, `drawDependency()`, `getConnectorEndSide()`, `getConnectorStartSide()`,
  `refreshDependency()` and `releaseDependency()` functions on the `Dependencies` feature has mistakenly been public
  ever since the feature was created. With the refactoring described above they are all now either removed or made
  private
* [DEPRECATED] The `drawForEvent()` fn of the `Dependencies` feature was deprecated. Calling it should no longer be
  necessary
* Removed the `removeUnassignedEvent` config from Scheduler. It was moved to `EventStore` back in 4.0 and was supposed
  to have been removed at the same time, it has not had any effect since

### BUG FIXES

* [#4681](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4681) - STM issues when using w/ backend
* [#4684](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4684) - Highlighted dependencies loose highlight on hover

## 5.0.6 - 2022-06-20

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* TimeRange feature now fires `timeRangeHeaderClick`,  `timeRangeHeaderDblClick` and  `timeRangeHeaderContextMenu`
  events when interacting with the header elements ([#4790](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4790))

### BUG FIXES

* [#4808](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4808) - Typings are wrong for async functions

## 5.0.5 - 2022-05-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Pan feature now is now also enabled when dragging in the time axis header. Can be disabled with the new
  `enableInHeader` config ([#4594](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4594))
* You can now render custom HTML contents inside TimeRange elements using the `headerRenderer` and `bodyRenderer`
  methods ([#4613](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4613))
* Added `paste` and `copy` events to the `EventCopyPaste` feature ([#4552](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4552))

### BUG FIXES

* [#4468](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4468) - Event disappears if dropped over group head
* [#4478](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4478) - Vertical time axis in Scheduler should show time labels aligned with lines like calendar week view
* [#4589](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4589) - `EventDrag` broken if async validation finalized without delay in `beforeEventDropFinalize`

## 5.0.4 - 2022-05-11

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The behaviour of the `EventCopyPaste` feature in a multi assignment scheduler is now better defined and also
  configurable using the new `copyPasteAction` config on the feature ([#4495](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4495))
* On a similar note the behaviour of `EventDragSelect` was also improved in a multi assigned scheduler. It now selects
  the assignments within the selection marquee rather than the events, giving you better control

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `records` param of the `beforeCopy` and `beforePaste` events triggered by the `EventCopyPaste`
  feature was deprecated in favour of the new `eventRecords` param

### BUG FIXES

* [#3832](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3832) - Change from invalid resourceId to valid resourceId of event throws error
* [#4526](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4526) - DragMove doesn't work on touch enabled laptops
* [#4562](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4562) - [REACT] React wrappers have incorrect source mapping urls

## 5.0.3 - 2022-04-26

### API CHANGES

* The `validateResponse` flag on `CrudManager` has been changed to default to `true`. When enabled, it validates
  `CrudManager` responses from the backend and outputs a message on console if the format isn't valid. This is helpful
  during the development phase, but can be turned off in production
* New Vue 2/3 wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents` (defaults to `false`). When set to `true`, the events fired
  by stores are relayed to the Bryntum Grid instance
* [REACT] React wrappers now include TypeScript definitions ([#3378](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3378))

### BUG FIXES

* [#4127](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4127) - [LWC] `DomHelper.isInView()` throws

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `ResourceFilter` in `Sidebar` should be configurable with custom selection ([#2006](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2006))
* EventDrag now adds `b-drop-target` class to all valid drop target elements on drag start when
  an `externalDropTargetSelector` is provided. ([#3888](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3888))
* The previously private event `visibleRangeChange` has been removed in favour of the public
  event `visibleDateRangeChange`. If your app made use of this event, please replace the event name
  ([#3876](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3876))

## 5.0.0 - 2022-02-21

* We are thrilled to announce version 5.0 of our Scheduler product. This release marks a big milestone for us, after
  more than a year of development. This update makes it much easier to combine multiple Bryntum products, and also
  includes new demos, improved state management as well as bug fixes and other enhancements requested by our community
  A big thanks to our customers who helped us with testing our alpha & beta versions
* You are most welcome to join us on March 16th, at 9am PST (6pm CET) for a 5.0 walkthrough webinar, demonstrating all
  the shiny new features
  [Click here to register](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/5116438317103/WN_4MkExpZPQsGYNpzh1mR_Ag)
* We hope you will enjoy this release and we are looking forward to hearing your feedback of what you would like us to
  develop next
* / Mats Bryntse, CEO @Bryntum

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Each product has a new "thin" JavaScript bundle. The thin bundle only contains product specific code, letting you
  combine multiple Bryntum products without downloading the shared code multiple times (previously only possible with
  custom-built bundles from sources). Find out more in the What's new guide ([#2805](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2805))
* Each theme is now available in a version that only has product specific CSS in it, called a `thin` version. These
  files are name `[product].[theme].thin.css` - `scheduler.stockholm.thin.css` for example. They are intended for using
  when you have multiple different bryntum products on the same page, to avoid including shared CSS multiple times
  Read more about it in the `What's new` section in docs ([#3276](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3276))
* `Model` has a new `readOnly` field that is respected by UI level editing features to disallow editing records having
  `readOnly : true`. It does not directly affect the datalayer, meaning that you can still programmatically edit the
  records ([#665](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/665))
* New `drag-from-list` demo showing how to drag items from an external List widget onto events in the schedule
  ([#3904](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3904))
* Scheduler's event rendering now uses absolute positioning instead of translation to position the event bars. This
  was changed to make native `position: sticky` work, the `stickyEvents` feature is now very thin and more performant
  ([#4055](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4055))
* New `ProjectModel` setters/getters for `assignments`, `dependencies`, `events`, `resourceTimeRanges`, `resources`,
  `timeRanges` ([#4043](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4043))
* New `deselectOnClick` to allow simple deselection of events with click ([#3221](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3221))
* `window` references are replaced with `globalThis` which is supported in all modern browsers and across different JS
  environments ([#4071](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4071))
* A new function called `downloadTestCase()` was added to Bryntum widgets, it is intended to simplify creating test
  cases for reporting issues on Bryntum's support forum. Running it collects the current value for the configs your app
  is using, inlines the current dataset and compiles that into a JavaScript app that is then downloaded. The app will
  most likely require a fair amount of manual tweaking to reproduce the issue, but we are hoping it will simplify the
  process for you. Run `scheduler.downloadTestCase()` on the console in a demo to try it
* The TimeAxis class now lets you change the `generateTicks` method during runtime ([#4199](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4199))
* Updated FontAwesome to version 6, which includes some new icons sponsored by Bryntum in the charts category:
  https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&c=charts-diagrams&s=solid
* When configured with a StateProvider and `stateId`, Scheduler state is stored automatically as stateful properties
  change ([#1859](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1859))
* Scheduler´s selectAssignment & deselectAssignment methods now receives the native DOM event allowing you to
  implement custom selection behaviors ([#4234](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4234))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] React wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd bundle. Hence
  application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and performance
  ([#2787](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2787))
* [DEPRECATED] Schedulers `horizontalEventSorterFn` config was deprecated and will be removed in 6.0. It was replaced by
  a new `overlappingEventSorter` config, which works identically but has a better name ([#3716](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3716))
* Code of drag-from-grid and similar demos have been simplified and if you have used that code in your application you
  should make sure to review and update your code accordingly
* Event bar root node now uses CSS grid layout for its internal layout. This may affect your appearance if you have
  customized the event bar markup

  `examples/frameworks/react/javascript/react-state` folder ([#3366](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3366))

### BUG FIXES

* [#3442](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3442) - Recurring events doesn't work in vertical mode
* [#3603](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3603) - ResourceTimeRange showing content from reused event element

## 4.3.0 - 2021-10-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [BREAKING] `@babel/preset-env` config target `chrome: 75` is now used for the UMD bundle. This decreases bundle size
  and improves performance for modern browsers ([#3201](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3201))
* Legacy Angular demos for versions 1-5 were removed due to incompatibility with the new UMD bundle format
* Dependency drawing was sped up a bit by not always recalculating dependency bounds. This change will give a boost
  to scroll performance for schedules with many dependencies ([#3486](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3486))

### API CHANGES

* TimeAxisColumn now subclasses WidgetColumn (before it was a Column), this should not affect your code. This opens up
  for rendering widgets embedded in row cells, see this demonstrated in the `examples/embedded-chart` demo in
  Scheduler Pro
* [DEPRECATED] Buttons `menuIconCls` config was deprecated in favor of the new `menuIcon` config, which better matches
  the naming of other configs

### BUG FIXES

* [#2811](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2811) - Zoomed-out dependencies do not display correctly
* [#3449](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3449) - `ResourceTimeRanges` disappear when many tasks are overlapping on a resource

* [#3521](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3521) - Time range and resource time range should not share `z-index`

## 4.2.7 - 2021-10-01

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `ComboBox` can now be configured to accept unmatched typed filter strings to create a new record. Use the
  `createOnUnmatched` config to enable this. This may be configured as a function to create the new record in an
  app-specific way. See the `eventeditor` example for usage ([#3249](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3249))
* You can now force single assignment mode using the `singleAssignment` config on EventStore ([#3287](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3287))

### BUG FIXES

## 4.2.6 - 2021-09-15

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The ResourceTimeRanges feature has a new `tabIndex` config that lets you control if the ranges are focusable/reachable
  using tab or not ([#3391](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3391))

### BUG FIXES

* [#3177](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3177) – React custom-event-editor demo issues

## 4.2.5 - 2021-09-08

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* ProjectModel now fires a `dataReady` event when the engine has finished its calculations and the result has been
  written back to the records ([#2019](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2019))
* The API documentation now better communicates when a field or property accepts multiple input types but uses a single
  type for output. For example date fields on models, which usually accepts a `String` or `Date` but always outputs a
  `Date` ([#2933](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2933))

### BUG FIXES

* [#223](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/223) - View preset should support any number of headers
* [#1482](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1482) - Show a tooltip when drag an event from the grid to scheduler

## 4.2.4 - 2021-08-27

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `EventDragCreate` feature has a new config called `lockLayout`. Set it to `true` to emulate the pre 4.2 drag
  create behaviour, locking events in place until user finishes the drag gesture. Also applies some styling to
  differentiate the event being created from the existing events when the config is used ([#3228](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3228))
* ScheduleTooltip feature has a new config `hideForNonWorkingTime` which hides it when hovering weekends and other
  non-working time ranges
* Scheduler's project (that holds all of its stores) now triggers a `change` event when data in any of the stores
  changes. Useful to listen for to keep an external data model up to date for example. This event is also relayed by
  Scheduler as `dataChange`, to allow easier binding in frameworks ([#3281](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3281))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `store` property on the TimeRanges feature was deprecated. The corresponding config was deprecated in
  4.0, the property should have been flagged at the same time

### BUG FIXES

## 4.2.3 - 2021-08-05

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* You can now define the default new event duration when double clicking schedule by setting
  config `createEventOnDblClick : { useEventModelDefaults : true }`. When setting config `useEventModelDefaults` to
  true, the default duration and durationUnit will be read from the default values of the `duration` and `durationUnit`
  fields of the EventModel. ([#3234](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3234))
* CrudManager can now log warnings to the browser console when it detects an unexpected response format. To enable these
  checks please use the `validateResponse` config ([#2668](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2668))
* Fixed a scroll performance regression introduced in version 4.2.2
* [NPM] Bryntum Npm server now supports remote private repository access for Artifactory with username and password
  authentication ([#2864](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2864))
* [TYPINGS] Type definitions now contain typed `features` configs and properties ([#2740](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2740))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] PdfExport feature `export` event is deprecated and will be removed in 4.3.0. Use `export` event on the
  Scheduler instead
* [DEPRECATED] Scheduler `beforeExport` event signature is deprecated and will be removed in 4.3.0. New signature wraps
  config object to the corresponding key

### BUG FIXES

## 4.2.2 - 2021-07-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* You can now distinguish new events being created using drag create (or double clicking in the schedule) by checking
  the Model#isCreating flag. In the DOM, a new CSS class b-sch-creating has been added to all events that are being
  created
* Added a new `hideRangesOnZooming` config to `NonWorkingTime` feature ([#2788](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2788)). The config allows to disable the
  feature default behavior when it hides ranges shorter than the base timeaxis unit on zooming out
* TimeRange feature can now show a tooltip when hovering a time range header element, by using the new `tooltipTemplate`
  config ([#3194](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3194))
* [NPM] Bryntum Npm server now supports `npm token` command for managing access tokens for CI/CD ([#2703](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2703))

## 4.2.0 - 2021-06-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler has a new config option `infiniteScroll` meaning that as the user scrolls the timeline back or forward in
  time, the "window" of time encapsulated by the TimeAxis is moved and the EventStore fires a `loadDateRange` event
  ([#1114](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1114))
* Dependencies can now be created by dropping on the target event without hitting the terminal circle element. The
  defaultValue of the DependencyModel `type` field will be used in this case. ([#3003](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3003))
* Dependency creation can now be finalized asynchronously, for example after showing the user a confirmation dialog
* The `EventResize` feature now uses the task's data to change the appearance by updating `endDate` or `startDate` live
  but in batched mode so that the changes are not available for server sync until the operation is finished
  ([#2541](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2541))
* EventResize now allows resizing an event to be zero duration, enable this behavior with the new `allowResizeToZero`
  config. ([#2945](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2945))
* Added "Upgrade Font Awesome icons to Pro version" guide
* Updated "Replacing Font Awesome with Material Icons" guide

* RowCopyPaste locales were updated to just say 'Copy', 'Cut' & 'Paste'. `copyRows`, `cutRows` & `pasteRows` keys were
  removed
* EventCopyPaste locales were updated to just say 'Copy', 'Cut' & 'Paste'. `copyRows`, `cutRows` & `pasteRows` keys were

## 4.1.5 - 2021-06-09

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The behaviour when dragging unselected events has changed slightly. Scheduler now selects the event from which a drag
  originates, whereas previously it did not
* [TYPINGS] API singleton classes are correctly exported to typings ([#2752](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2752))
* Added a new ResourceCollapse column to toggle `eventLayout` of a resource between overlap and stack. A new
  `resource-collapsing` demo has been added to showcase the feature ([#2979](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2979))
* Scheduler now has a `minHeight` of `10em` by default. This assures that the Scheduler will get a size even if no other
  sizing rules are applied for the element it is rendered to. When the default `minHeight` is driving the height, a
  warning is shown on the console to let the dev know that sizing rules are missing. The warning is not shown if a
  `minHeight` is explicitly configured ([#2915](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2915))

## 4.1.3 - 2021-05-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Bumped the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to 5.15.3 and added missing imports to allow stacked icons etc
* Bumped the `@babel/preset-env` config target to `chrome: 75` for the Module bundle. This decreased bundle sizes and
  improved performance for modern browsers

## 4.1.0 - 2021-04-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We are happy to announce that Bryntum Scheduler now can be directly installed using our npm registry. We've updated
  all our frameworks demos to use `@bryntum` npm packages. See them in `examples/frameworks` folder. Please refer to "
  Npm packages" guide in docs for registry login and usage information
* Added a new "Non-working days" demo
* Bryntum demos were updated with XSS protection code. `StringHelper.encodeHtml` and `StringHelper.xss` functions were
  used for this
* Model fields can now be marked with `alwaysWrite` to ensure important data fields are always included when updates are
  committed by a CrudManager ([#848](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/848))
* CrudManager now exposes a `changes` property returning an object with the current changes in its stores
* Added new Vue Cell Renderer demo to show Vue Components as cell renderers (Partially fixed [#946](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/946) - Vue: Support
  components in renderers)
* Schedulers performance was improved compared to version 4.0, mainly by shortening critical code paths such as getting
  record field values and by reducing the amount of work performed during the engines initial commit
* Summary feature now offers a `refresh` method to update summaries. See updated summary demo for sample usage
* Custom rendered HTML for events is no longer wrapped in an element unless there are other elements (such as icon) to
  also render
* Added new Vue 3 Simple demo to show integration of Bryntum Scheduler with Vue 3 ([#1315](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1315))
* `eventColor` can now be specified as any valid CSS style (hex, hsl, rgba etc) ([#2314](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2314))
* The Labels feature can now be configured to make event labels take part in the event layout process, preventing them
  from being overlapped by other events ([#2147](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2147))
* Added new React 17 demo for Scheduler in vertical mode. The example also implements theme switching ([#1823](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1823) and
  [#2213](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2213))
* ResourceInfoColumn now shows resource initials if no avatar image exists ([#2202](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2202))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] Removed RequireJS demos and integration guides in favor of modern ES6 Modules technology ([#1963](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1963))
* [BREAKING] `init` method is no longer required in Lightning Web Components and was removed from the LWC bundle

## 4.0.8 - 2021-01-27

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* You can now position milestone text inside the diamond or outside (default) with the new `milestoneTextPosition`
  config
* You can now opt out of sticky event behavior for individual Events, using the EventModel#stickyContents field
* Crud Manager now supports less strict `sync` response format allowing to respond only server side changes
  See `supportShortSyncResponse` config for details

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] Crud Manager default behaviour has been changed to allow `sync` response to include only server-side
  changes. Previously it was mandatory to mention each updated/removed record in the response to confirm the changes
  With this release the Crud Manager automatically confirms changes of all updated/removed records mentioned in
  corresponding request. To revert to previous strict behaviour please use `supportShortSyncResponse` config

### BUG FIXES

* [#1970](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1970) - Infinite requests if wrong response received
* [#2241](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2241) - PDF export fails with certain column combination

## 4.0.7 - 2021-01-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler now supports per resource row height, by setting `resource.rowHeight`. The value is used as the actual row
  height for pack and overlap event layouts, and as input for the row height calculation with stack layout. It is also
  possible to control the setting from a column renderer. If no value is supplied, the height configured on the
  Scheduler is used ([#2158](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2158))
* Also added per resource event layout support, by setting the new corresponding `resource.eventLayout` field. It
  accepts the same options as `scheduler.eventLayout` (stack, pack, none), and if the field is unspecified it will use
  the layout configured on the Scheduler ([#176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/176))

### BUG FIXES

* A new Scheduler feature `StickyEvents` enables the textual content of event bars to "stick" within the scrolling
  viewport until the event itself is out of view. ([#390](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/390))
* Added `groupRecord`, `groupField`, `groupValue` to `GroupSummary.renderer` config and `SummaryFormatter.generateHtml`
  method ([#1897](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1897))
* A new config `discardPortals` on the React wrapper, that controls the behaviour of cell renderers using React
  components. Set to `false` (default) to enhance performance. Set to `true` to limit memory consumption
* With the TimeRanges feature, you can now easily configure current time indicator to show any text using the updated
  `showCurrentTimeLine` object config
* New fields `resourceMargin` and `barMargin` was added to `ResourceModel`, allowing for per row adjustment of the
  resource margin and the bar margin respectively ([#2014](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2014))

### API CHANGES

* EventEdit feature now exposes an 'isEditing' boolean to detect if the editor is currently visible ([#1935](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1935))
* You can now specify the date to scroll into view initially, using the new `visibleDate` config
* Task and event renderings that return HTML are now placed in a `<span>`. Previously, such text was placed inside a
  `<div>` but the block-level element caused undesirable wrapping. This applies to simple cases such as names with an
  ampersand (`'&'`) character. Simple text is still rendered as a text node. ([#1989](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1989))
* [DEPRECATED] The `getSourceEvent()` and `getTargetEvent()` functions in `DependencyModel` was deprecated in favor of
  the `fromEvent` and `toEvent` getters

## 4.0.3 - 2020-11-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* A new Scheduler widget type `undoredo` has been added which, when added to the `tbar` of a scheduling widget
  (such as a `Scheduler`, `Gantt`, or `Calendar`), provides undo and redo functionality
* A new config, `collapseToHeader` on the `GroupSummary` feature makes the headers row of a collapsed group contain the
  summary data for the group. Be aware that the group title is limited in width in a collapsed group header with this
  set so that it does not overflow into summary cells. ([#1355](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1355))
* Added example to columns localization on guide. ([#1846](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1846))
* New `suspendAutoSync()` and `resumeAutoSync()` methods added `ProjectModel` to prevent CrudManager sync operations
  temporarily. ([#1853](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1853))

## 4.0.0 - 2020-10-19

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [BREAKING] Dropped Support for Edge 18 and older. Our Edge <=18 fixes are still in place and active, but we will not
  be adding more fixes. Existing fixes will be removed in a later version
* [BREAKING] Parts of the Scheduler data layer now use async operations, matching how Scheduler Pro and Gantt works
  This affects manipulations of dates and durations, where the UI will not be updated immediately after data
  manipulations but instead moments later. See the upgrade guide for more information
* Scheduler now optionally can be configured with a `project`. A project is an entity that holds all the stores used by
  the Scheduler, a concept moved down from Gantt & Scheduler Pro. If no project is supplied, one is created internally
  Please see the upgrade guide for more details
* [BREAKING] Multi-assignment was made a first class feature of Scheduler. The Scheduler now always uses an
  AssignmentStore internally. If none is assigned one will be created automatically. This change enables
  multi-assignment to work with more features, since it is now the only mode of operation internally. It still supports
  single assignment using the `resourceId` field on events, by automatically creating assignment records in an internal
  AssignmentStore on load/add/change. We recommend transitioning to always use assignments, as
  `resourceId` might get deprecated in the future
* [BREAKING] The `Core/adapter` directory has been removed. There are no longer any Widget adapters. All Widget classes
  register themselves with the `Widget` class, and the `Widget` class is the source of Widget `type` mapping and Widget
  registration and lookup by `id`
* [BREAKING] The way recurring events are inserted into a Scheduler's timeline has changed. Instead of occurrences being
  dynamically generated upon every data change and change of a scheduler's time axis, no extra events are added into the
  store. Occurrences of recurring events are ephemeral and are returned from the new `EventStore.getEvents` API when
  necessary. This should not affect the default operations of apps, but the differences may be apparent in more
  sophisticated apps. To change an occurrence use `occurrence.beginBatch`, then make changes to including setting its
  `recurrence` to null if it's to be a one-off exception, then use `occurrence.endBatch`. That will update the data and
  the UI. See the upgrade guide in the documentation
* [BREAKING] The `Default`, `Light` and `Dark` themes were renamed to `Classic`, `Classic-Light` and `Classic-Dark`
  This change highlights the fact that they are variations of the same theme, and that it is not the default theme
  (Stockholm is our default theme since version 2.0)
* Context menu features refactoring, please see the upgrade guide for details ([#128](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/128)):
    - naming was simplified by removing the word "Context" in feature names and in event names
    - introduced named objects for menu items, allowing easier customization
    - split context menu features by area of responsibility
    - introduced TimeAxisHeaderMenu feature and made it responsible for header menu of TimeAxis column
* Added support for toggling `constrainDragToResource` dynamically ([#542](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/542))
* The HeaderContextMenu feature was refactored and renamed to TimeAxisHeaderMenu ([#8783](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8783))
* Column lines are now drawn using divs instead of images + divs. Only divs for lines in view are available in DOM. This
  allows for easier styling and testing of column lines, while only having a very minor impact on performance
* TimeRanges can now show an icon using the `iconCls` field in the data model
* A new event style "rounded" was added, try the updated `eventstyles` demo to see it in action
* Added new config `verticalTimeAxisColumn` that allows configuring the `VerticalTimeAxisColumn` instance used in
  vertical mode with any Column options that apply to it. Changed "vertical" example to use the new
  `verticalTimeAxisColumn` configuration with a field to search values ([#1136](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1136))
* Added a new demo + guide showing how to create a custom event editor ([#957](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/957))
* Events have acquired an extra internal element, `.b-sch-event-content`. It is used to allow `text-overflow: ellipsis`,
  padding without affecting minimum width and to allow us to much easier place labels for milestones. It also gives you
  more styling options for your custom look, having an additional element to leverage. Note though that it might affect
  any custom event styling you are using
* Scheduler CrudManager PHP demo now supports multiple resource assignment
* The 3d-bars demo was removed. It has a history of being broken in many releases and was deemed not worth keeping
* Scheduler now extends `Panel` instead of `Container`. This allows you to easily add toolbars to it ([#1417](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1417))
* Added XSS protection to default renderers (based on `StringHelper.encodeHtml` and `StringHelper.xss`)
* Added support to export events to ICS format with the new `TimeSpan#exportToICS` method. Demonstrated in the new
  `exporttoics` example
* Added `scheduler.lite.umd.js` module that does not include `Promise` polyfill. This module is primarily intended to be
  used with Angular to prevent `zone.js` polyfills overwrite
* Added experimental support for Salesforce Locking Service ([#359](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/359)). The distributed bundle only supports modern
  browsers (no IE11 or non-chromium based Edge), since Salesforce drops support for these in January 1st 2021 too
* Added Lightning Web Component demo, see `examples/salesforce/src/lwc`
* Dependencies feature has a new public method to get a dependency record from the corresponding DOM element. See
  `resolveDependencyRecord` docs for details

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] The `dependencies` feature no longer holds its own store, instead it is configured on Scheduler or in a
  project along with the other stores used by Scheduler. The same applies if configuring it with inline data, the
  `dependencies` config was moved to Scheduler to match how inline data is supplied for other stores
* [BREAKING] Events triggered by the EventDrag feature now always supplies assignment records and event records. If you
  currently use multi-assignment, you might need to adjust your listeners
* [BREAKING] `RecurringEvents` feature was removed. Use the `enableRecurringEvents` boolean config on the Scheduler
* [BREAKING] `RecurringTimeSpans` feature was removed as no longer needed for displaying recurring events
* [BREAKING] Event selection now more clearly distinguishes between selected assignments and selected events. Previously
  for example `scheduler.selectedEvents` would return events or assignments depending on mode. Now it always returns
  events, and assignments are returned by `scheduler.selectedAssignments`. The same thinking applies to the events
  triggered by selection, there is now a new `assignmentSelectionChange` event in addition to the existing
  `eventSelectionChange`
* [BREAKING] The `removeUnassignedEvent` config was moved from Scheduler to EventStore. If you have it explicitly
  configured with `false` or are using a standalone EventStore you might have to add/move it in your code. If you rely
  on an event record being available after being unassigned, you should configure with `removeUnassignedEvent: false`
* [BREAKING] An EventStore is no longer directly linked to a ResourceStore or an AssignmentStore. Nor does it handle the
  date normalization on its own. If you are using standalone stores (not connected to a Scheduler), you have to use a
  project to hold the stores. See the upgrade guide for more information
* [BREAKING] Event records can no longer be shared between multiple stores. The stores can still be shared
* [BREAKING] Field `serialize` function `this` has been changed to refer the field definition (it used to refer the
  model instance before)
* [BREAKING] A clarification to changes in alpha-1, regarding async date manipulation: Dates and durations are also
  calculated async when data is loaded or new events are added. To simplify the transition to this approach new
  awaitable `addAsync()` and `loadDataAsync()` functions were added to project stores. See upgrade guide for more
  information ([#1505](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1505))
* [DEPRECATED] `context.draggedRecords` argument of `Scheduler.feature.EventDrag.validatorFn` function is deprecated
  Use `context.eventRecords` instead
* [DEPRECATED] The `tplData` param in the `eventRenderer` function was deprecated in favor of the new `renderData` param
* [DEPRECATED] abstract `TimeSpanRecordContextMenuBase` class was deprecated, in favor of `TimeSpanMenuBase`
* [DEPRECATED] `HeaderContextMenu` feature was deprecated. `TimeAxisHeaderMenu` was introduced instead
* [DEPRECATED] `EventContextMenu` feature was renamed to `EventMenu`
* [DEPRECATED] `ScheduleContextMenu` feature was renamed to `ScheduleMenu`
* [DEPRECATED] `occurrencesready` event has been removed
* Event elements no longer use cryptic ids (like `id="scheduler-57-r2-x"`). If you need a CSS selector for a specific
  event, you can instead use `[data-event-id="myid"]`. Following this simplification, the `getResourceRecordFromDomId()`
  and `getEventRecordFromDomId()` functions has been removed
* The `WidgetColumn.onBeforeWidgetSetValue` and `WidgetColumn.onAfterWidgetSetValue` functions was made public to allow
  greater control
* Model fields in derived classes are now merged with corresponding model fields (by name) in super classes. This allows
  serialization and other attributes to be inherited when a derived class only wants to change the `defaultValue` or
  other attribute of the field
* The `dateFormat` config for `type='date'` model fields has been simplified to `format`
* Model date fields are serialized by default according to the field `format` ([#273](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/273))
* Schedulers "main" stores (EventStore, ResourceStore, AssignmentStore and DependencyStore) has had their event
  triggering modified to make sure data is in a calculated state when relevant events are triggered. This affects the
  timing of the `add`, `remove`, `removeAll`, `change` and `refresh` events. Please see the upgrade guide for more
  information ([#1486](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1486))
* The following previously deprecated members/classes were removed:
    - `ResourceImageColumn.imagePath` and `ResourceImageColumn.defaultImageName`
    - `EditBase.extraWidgets`
    - `ViewPreset`, compatibility layer introduced in 3.0 was removed
    - `TimelineDateMapper.getDateFromX()`
    - `TimelineEventRendering.tickWidth`
    - `beforeZoomChange` and `zoomChange` events for `TimelineViewPresets`

## 3.0.0 - 2019-12-20

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* New Ionic Themes demo which shows using and changing included themes. (#9394)
* Added support for exporting the Scheduler to PDF and PNG. It is showcased in several examples, pdf-export for Angular,
  React and Vue frameworks, as well as in examples/export. The feature requires a special export server, which you can
  find in the examples/_shared/server folder. You will find more instructions in the README.md file in each new demo. (
  #6268)
* Added public config to disable recurring event fields in event editor UI ([#71](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/71))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] The `ViewPreset` now uses a `headers` array instead of named header levels in a `headerConfig` property. So
  the `columnLinesFor` property is now an index into that array. (#9325, #4469)
* ViewPresets and zoom levels were refactored for easier usage. `ViewPresets` are now contained in a `PresetStore` and
  zooming steps between them, removing the need of manually defining `zoomLevels`
* TimeSpan (and its subclasses such as EventModel) now uses `DateHelper.defaultFormat` as the default format for parsing
  strings to dates (applies to `startDate` and `endDate`). The actual format used by default is still the same, but now
  more easily configurable ([#32](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/32))
* Scheduler now also uses `DateHelper.defaultFormat` as its default format for the timeaxis start and end dates. This
  change makes it behave slightly different, previously it would expect milliseconds in its format and now it does not
* Scheduler#getDateFromX is deprecated because it is orientation dependent. Scheduler#getDateFromCoordinate should be
  used if you have the position on the correct axis, or Scheduler.getDateFromXY if you have a coordinate pair

### BUG FIXES

* [#65](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/65) - Event is not repainted to the updated time if its resource has been changed too
* [#72](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/72) - Drop date is resolved based on cursor position instead of proxy element
* #8569 - Scheduler doesn't paint events for resource with id 0
* #8570 - Dependencies with id: null are reusing one dependency line
* #9456 - Event editor recurring UI should be hidden when RecurringEvents feature is disabled

  smaller custom builds using for example WebPack. See the new `custom-build` demo for a possible setup (#7883)
* Event removal using keyboard and the event editor is now both preventable through the `beforeEventDelete` event
  triggered on Scheduler (#8681)

* Support for disabling features at runtime has been improved, all features except Tree can now be disabled at any time
* Widgets may now adopt a preexisting DOM node to use as their encapsulating `element`. This reduces DOM footprint when
  widgets are being placed inside existing applications, or when used inside UI frameworks which provide a DOM node. See
  the `adopt` config option. (#9414)
* The `dragfromgrid` demo was updated with toggling between vertical and horizontal mode (#8985)
* The `drag-between-schedulers` and `partners` demos uses a new Splitter widget to allow adjusting the size of the
  Schedulers (#9138)
* Experimental: The React wrapper has been updated to support using React components (JSX) in cell renderers and as cell
  editors. Please check out the updated React demos to see how it works (#7334, #9043)
* React Integration Guide updated with information on new JSX and React Components renderers and editors support

## 2.1.1 - 2019-06-14

### BUG FIXES

* Unfortunately we broke event animations in 2.1.0, this release re-enables them

## 2.1.0 - 2019-06-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Bumped built in FontAwesome to version 5.8.2
* Demos now have a built in code editor that allows you to edit their code (Chrome only) and CSS (#7210)
* Scheduler now supports selecting multiple events using drag drop (#8647)
* Scheduler now has a new SimpleEventEdit feature for editing the name of an event (#8648)
* Multiple new Angular demos added, see the `examples/angular` folder

### API CHANGES

* The `cls` property of `Scheduler.model.Event` is now an instance of `Common.helper.util.DomClassList`. Code which uses
  it as a string will continue to work as the class has a `toString` inplementation, and the the `set Cls` setter will
  promote incoming strings. But using the `DomClassList` API allows easy adding and removal of individual CSS classes,
  easy testing for presence of a CSS class and more accurate comparisons of two Events' classes. The
  `DomClassList#isEqual` method will work regardless of the _order_ that class names were added
* Scheduler repaints dependencies asynchronously when dependency, assignment or event is changed. Use
  `dependenciesDrawn` event to know when dependency lines are actually painted. `draw`, `drawDependency` and
  `drawForEvent` are still synchronous
* [BREAKING] Context menu Features are configured in a slightly different way in this version. If you have used the
  `extraItems` or `processItems` options to change the contents of the shown menu, this code must be updated. Instead of
  using `extraItems`, use `items`

  The `items` config is an *`Object`* rather than an array. The property values are your new submenu configs, and the
  property name is the menu item name. In this way, you may add new items easily, but also, you may override the
  configuration of the default menu items that we provide

  The default menu items now all have documented names (see the `defaultItems` config of the Feature), so you may apply
  config objects which override default config. To remove a provided default completely, specify the config value as
  `false`

  This means that the various `showXxxxxxxInContextMenu` configs in the Scheduler are now ineffective. Simply use for
  example, `items : { deleteEvent : false }` to remove a provided item by name

  `processItems` now recieves its `items` parameter as an `Object`, so finding predefined named menu items to mutate is
  easier. Adding your own entails adding a new named config object. Use the `weight` config to affect the menu item
  order. Provided items are `weight : 0`. Weight values may be negative to cause your new items to gravitate to the top
* [DEPRECATED] EventEdit's `extraWidgets` config was deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use
  `extraItems` instead
* [BREAKING] EventSelection#deselectEvent now always maintains current selected events. (#8646)

### BUG FIXES

* #8657 - Presets should have column lines defined for the lowest header level by default
* #8663 - Rendering broken in drag from grid demo

## 2.0.3 - 2019-05-23

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* EventDrag feature can now be programmatically disabled

### API CHANGES

* CrudManager would previously when used with a tree store erroneously append new records from the backend without
  specified `parentId` to the first record in the store, whereas it now will append them to the root

### BUG FIXES

* #7561 - Should be able to use Grid & Scheduler & Gantt bundles on the same page
* #8350 - Pan feature should also scroll the view by clicking on an event when drag and drop is disabled
* #8369 - ResourceInfoColumn should show default image if loading fails

* #8431 - Drag between schedulers demo not working with mobile device
* #8484 - New events not saved in CrudManager demo
* #8487 - Unchanged events in row are animated upon event add

## 2.0.2 - 2019-05-10

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Scheduler now only redraws affected rows if events change, greatly speeding up cases where a change does not affect
  the height of the row (#8303)
* Labels for TimeRanges are now rendered in the time axis header to not be covered by task elements in the timeline
  (`showHeaderElements` config of the feature switched to `true` by default)

## 2.0.0 - 2019-03-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* New demo using WebSockets added (client + server)
* New demo using Ionic added (#7426)
* New demo showing integration to the Vuestic web app (IE11 is not supported) (#7831)
* New demo showing cascading combos in Event Editor (#7755)
* New demo using Rough.js for custom sketched event styling added (#7493)
* Demos ported to vue: drag-from-grid, drag-onto-tasks (TypeScript, [#756](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/756))
* Included a new default theme called "stockholm"
* Added animation for first display of events (#7550)
* Scheduler now supports filtering the time axis ticks and/or defining a custom tick generator to create a
  non-continuous time axis. Try the new `timeaxis` demo to see it in action (#6597)
* Added support for specifying working days and hours, which will be used to either filter the time axis or stretch the
  rendered events depending on zoom level (#7536)
* Removed flatpickr as our time picker for `TimeField` and replaced with our own implementation (#7396)
* Made it possible to manipulate items of HeaderContextMenu before show (#7544)
* Added support for using dependencies with multi assigned events (#6749)
* Added API to show context menu for event record (#7621)
* Scheduler now supports multiple regions for columns, as opposed to only two previously (locked and normal). Check out
  the new columns demo to see how it works (#7642)
* Add support for dashed and dotted lines to the ColumnLines feature (#7653)
* Events can now be split in pieces using the new `split` API. Demonstrated in tooltips demo and eventcontextmenu demo
* Angular demos no longer use `autoHeight`, instead they get their height from CSS as most of other demos do. This makes
  code from them a bit easier to reuse outside of our demos (#7767)
* EventEdit feature now triggers a `beforeEventEditShow` event on scheduler after constructing the editor and loading
  the event, but before being shown. Allows you to hook in to for example filter the resources combo (#7520)
* Added a `style` field to the `TimeSpan` model. Can be used to apply custom styling to events, time ranges and resource
  time ranges (#7596)
* New `getVisibleDateRange()` API added (#7876)
* The CrudManager `AjaxTransport` mixin now uses our internal AjaxHelper and the fetch API for transport,
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

### API CHANGES

* Previously private field accessors on the event editor feature were made public (nameField, resourceField etc.) to for
  example allow manipulation of shown resources when displaying the editor (#7519)
* TimeAxisViewModel was made public, it handles mapping between the data based time axis and the UI. You can access it
  using `scheduler.timeAxisViewModel` to find out the date at a specific pixel etc
* EventContextMenu#onElementContextMenu is private now, use EventContextMenu#showContextMenuFor instead
* 'beforeEventDrag' is no longer fired on mousedown, but on the first mousemove following a mousedown (#7723)
* [BREAKING] The `renderEventsAsContainers` has been removed, and the rendering simplified. All Events are rendered
  inside their own wrapper element. _This will only affect you if you have custom styling applying to event elements and
  were not using `renderEventsAsContainers: true`_
* [BREAKING] TimeField's and DateField's `pickerFormat` config was removed in favour of using `format` also for the
  picker
* [BREAKING] EventEditors resource field was renamed from `resourceIdField` -> `resourceField` to reflect the fact that
  it might involve multi assignment (#7518)
* [BREAKING] Scheduler now renders it contents on `paint` instead of on `render`, to allow it to initialize correct when
  embedded in tab panels and similar. Because of this change, the `render` event was removed
* [BREAKING] `idField` config was removed from `Store`, it was not used in the codebase and did not work as intended
  The config is still available and working on `Model`, set it on your subclass (`MyModelClass.idField = 'MyId'`). If
  you really want to remap id to another field in your data without subclassing `Model` you can still do it using the
  `fields` config on `Store`: `new Store({ fields : [{ name : 'id', dataSource : 'MyId' }] });`

### BUG FIXES

* #7422 - Cannot read property 'atob' of undefined
* #7483 - finalize method called twice when cancelling event resizing
* #7500 - Crash in CrudManager demo if making changes while sync is in progress
* #7599 - Event rendering in month is a bit off
* #7669 - TimeField in EventEditor left/right buttons should use same increment as current viewPreset
  timeResolution
* #7675 - EditBase should check field validity in a more precise manner
* #7719 - Assignment cannot be moved correctly if it overlaps with itself and allowOverlap is false
* #7708 - ScheduleTip and EventTip disabled after dragging en event out of view
* #7726 - DOCS: Complete list of defaults
* #7732 - Event selection lost after loading new dataset which contains previously selected event id
* #7733 - Old selected events not cleaned up when a dataset changes
* #7735 - TimeSpan.normalize should respect mapping
* #7758 - ViewPreset headerConfig "align" has no effect
* #7760 - ViewPreset headerConfig "headerCls" has no effect
* #7761 - Some feature methods, exposed to scheduler, are not typed properly
* #7770 - Events not deleted when parent tree node deleted
* #7802 - Incorrect dates on the timeaxis when resolution unit is month
* #7810 - Filterable timeaxis doesn't work with DAY shift unit
* #7863 - Crash after drag drop when scrolled to bottom and replacing events dataset
* #7869 - Setting showCurrentTimeLine to false doesn't work

## 1.2.5 - 2019-02-26

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Updated the React guide to reflect the change of bundle used in the demo (it uses scheduler.module.transpiled.js to
  allow the demo to run in IE11)

### BUG FIXES

* Renamed event relay prefix in the vue wrapper to avoid naming collisions (eventStore -> events etc.)
* Fixed react_typescript build

## 1.2.4 - 2019-02-19

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Updated `readme.md` to better describe the projects folder structure and different included bundles

### BUG FIXES

* #7560 - Crash in GroupSummary demo
* #7629 - Error when building Angular demos

## 1.2.3 - 2019-02-14

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added a date picker to EventEditor, Angular, and Vue demos (#7584)

### BUG FIXES

* #7547 - STYLING: Wrong selection style for group header rows
* #7563 - Scroll reset in partners demo
* #7590 - STYLING: Headers missing padding in IE11
* #7608 - react_build demo is broken
* #7609 - passStartEndParameters config has no effect
* #7619 - Dblclicking a summary row should not create a new event
* #7620 - Incorrect position for events below collapsed group in groupsummary demo

## 1.2.2 - 2019-01-28

### API CHANGES

* ANGULAR: The Scheduler component was previously relaying events from EventStore and ResourceStore by prefixing them
  with `eventStore` and `resourceStore`, making it possible to listen for for example `eventStoreAdd` or
  `resourceStoreRemove`. The prefix was causing naming collisions internally and have now been changed to `events`
  and `resources` -> `eventsAdd` / `resourcesRemove`. In case you rely on this in your code, you need to rename to match
  the new pattern

### BUG FIXES

* #7529 - After a drag on empty calendar spot, the scheduleClick event is no more fired
* #7541 - Crash when updating rendered timerange to be nonrendered
* #7558 - Error during dragdrop in angular demo
* #7555 - Drag from grid example throws error

## 1.2.1 - 2019-01-17

### API CHANGES

* The behaviour when setting `startDate` after initialization on Scheduler has changed from modifying the length of the
  displayed time range to instead shift it backwards or forwards, keeping its duration. `endDate` still modifies the
  length of the time range. To allow control over this behaviour `setStartDate` and `setEndDate` methods have been added
  to the Scheduler, both accepting a `keepDuration` flag (#7410)

### BUG FIXES

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* React wrapper changed to use `shouldComponentUpdate()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
* Added React + TypeScript demo (#7283)

* Built in version of FontAwesome was bumped to 5.5.0

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] AssignmentModels `getEvent()`, `getResource()`, `getEventName()` and `getResourceName()` removed in favor
  of properties `event`, `resource`, `eventName` and `resourceName`
* [BREAKING] TimeRanges `rangeCls` and `lineCls` were made private
* `DependencyStore#getEventIncomingDependencies` renamed to `getEventpredecessors`
* `DependencyStore#getEventOutgoingDependencies` renamed to `getEventsuccessors`

## 1.1.2 - 2018-11-23

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* EventTooltip docs updated to show that you can use Tooltip configs to affect the tooltip

### API CHANGES

* CSS class `b-sch-minuteIndicator` renamed to `b-sch-minute-indicator`
* CSS class `b-sch-hourIndicator` renamed to `b-sch-hour-indicator`

### BUG FIXES

* #7153 - Adding 100 records in a loop does not extend the scroll range of the grid
* #7167 - End date icon inconsistent with the date it's shown next to
* #7174 - record.imageUrl should have a priority and stay as it is
* #7185 - Readding a removed resource renders events after scroll
* #7191 - STYLING: Wrong color in dark theme for nbr events text in resource info column

### API CHANGES

* Calling TimeSpan#startDate setter and TimeSpan#setStartDate will now move the span in time as opposed to earlier where
  it would modify the duration of the event

* #7003 - Vue wrapper naming collision
* #7120 - Cannot use ids containing "-" on events or resources
* #7125 - Export feature doesn't export correct data by default
* #7129 - Crash when localizing time units
* #7130 - Web Components demo throws 404s
* #7132 - Setting start date > end date results in negative duration
* #7136 - Duration field should spin on up/down keys
* #7143 - Strange scroller behavior in dragfromgrid demo

### API CHANGES

* `Scheduler` has a new `parter` config which pairs the `Scheduler` with the passed `Scheduler`, sharing the
  `TimeAxis`, and synchronizing the horizontal scroll positions
* Scheduler now defaults to remove the event when removing its last assignment. This behaviour can be changed using the
  `removeUnassignedEvent` config
* Scheduler has a new `triggerSelectionChangeOnRemove` config that determines if `eventSelectionChange` should trigger
  or not when removing a selected event
* [BREAKING] ViewPresets property `timeColumnWidth` and related getters and setters was renamed to `tickWidth`
  `timeColumnWidth` can still be used for backwards compatibility, but if you are using a custom ViewPreset we recommend
  that you rename to be future proof
* [BREAKING] EventDrag#validatorFn now receives the drag context in one context object (similar to dragCreate and
  eventResize features), instead of multiple params
* [DEPRECATED] In the context object parameter (first param) of the EventResize#validatorFn, 'start' and 'end' were
  deprecated in favor of 'startDate' + 'endDate'
* [DEPRECATED] In the context object parameter (first param) of the EventDragCreate#validatorFn, 'start' and 'end' were
  deprecated in favor of 'startDate' + 'endDate'

  object was made private
* [BREAKING] In the SchedulerEventRendering#eventRenderer template method, the following properties of the
  `detail.tplData` object were made private: `start`, `end`, `startMs`, `endMs`, `startsOutsideView`, `endOutsideView`,
  `resourceId`, `resource`, `id` and `eventId`. A new `height` property was added to `tplData` which lets your read the
  event height

### BUG FIXES

* #6098 - Scheduler may be partnered with another Scheduler to share TimeAxis and scroll position
* #6720 - Schedule and timeaxis out of sync after calling scrollEventIntoView
* #6723 - Dependency lines for events which have been deleted reappear when the scheduler subgrid is scrolled

## 1.0.4 - 2018-10-08

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Angular demo improved: relays more events from the engine, added eventLayout config
