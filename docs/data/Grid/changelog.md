* Column widths and hide/show state are synced between partnered schedulers with identical column sets ([#6682](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6682))

### API CHANGES

* In a group header row, the expand/collapse icon is now a separate element rather than a pseudo-element of the header
  cell

### API CHANGES

* `Checkbox` selection column is no longer hideable by the user by default (can be toggled in code by setting `hideable`
  to `true`) ([#6650](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6650))

## 5.3.3 - 2023-04-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `CellEdit` feature's `autoEdit` functionality now triggers a `beforeCellRangeDelete` event which by returning
  `false`, can prevent the deletion on multiple cell values. When only deleting a single value, the already existing
  `beforeCellEditStart` event is used as before
* [ANGULAR] Bryntum Grid now ships with two npm Angular wrapper packages to support different versions of Angular
  framework. Existing `@bryntum/grid-angular` package is now designed to work with Angular 12 and newer versions,
  which use the IVY rendering engine. New `@bryntum/grid-angular-view` package is designed to work with Angular 11
  and older versions, which use the View Engine rendering. Check Upgrading and Angular integration guides in
  documentation for more information ([#6270](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6270))
* [ANGULAR] `angular-9`, `angular-10` and `angular-11` demos have been added to show use of `@bryntum/grid-angular-view`
  package with Angular 9, 10 and 11. Demos are located in subfolders inside `examples/frameworks/angular/` folder
* [ANGULAR] `angular-12`, `angular-13` and `angular-14` demos have been added for Angular 12, 13 and 14. Demos are
  located in subfolders inside `examples/frameworks/angular/` folder
* [ANGULAR] `basic` demo has been upgraded to use Angular 15. Demo is localed in located in
  `examples/frameworks/angular/basic/` folder
* [ANGULAR] legacy `angular-6`, `angular-7` and `angular-8` demos has been removed

### API CHANGES

* Removed `skipRefresh` argument from Grid's `toggleCollapse()` function, since it was not working and there was no
  code to back it up
* [DEPRECATED] Events triggered by the `RowReorder` feature have been deprecated and now instead trigger on the owning
  Grid instance (all other features follow this pattern). Old events fired by RowReorder will be removed in 6.0
  ([#6579](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6579))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5758](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5758) - Tree column `autoHeight` not working
* [#6166](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6166) - `createOnUnmatched` only creates new record on `Enter` key press
* [#6483](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6483) - Grid header alignment Issue when using 3+ levels headers

* [#6548](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6548) - `Backspace` key not working in cell editor with `combo`
  combo

* [#6620](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6620) - Dynamically created SubGrid's `xScroller` does not have a reference to the outer `Y` scroller

## 5.3.2 - 2023-04-04

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Grid's `ColumnStore` now uses `syncDataOnLoad : true` (and it is not intended to be changed by apps), which improves
  performance for state changes when binding to `<bryntum-grid columns="">` in frameworks (Partial fix [#6340](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6340))
* The backends for the `php` and `php-paging` demos were updated to work with PHP 8

### API CHANGES

* The docs for the Grid's `selectionChange` and `beforeSelectionChange` events mistakenly showed that the `deselected`,
  `selected` and `selection` params included records or cells, when they only included records. That have been fixed,
  and we also added `deselectedCells`, `selectedCells` and `cellSelection` params to same events.
* Context menu items for copying and pasting rows (from the `RowCopyPaste` feature) are no longer combined with menu
  items for copying and pasting cells (from `CellCopyPaste`). To show both cell & row copy items in the same menu,
  enable the `rowOptionsOnCellContextMenu` config.

## 5.3.1 - 2023-03-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Tree store now applies filters/sorters to any new data when calling `applyChangeset()` ([#6155](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6155))

### API CHANGES

* Removed obsolete config `keepUncommittedChanges` for chained stores. It did not affect chained store behavior
* `expanded` field was moved to `Model` class from `GridRowModel`
* Date parsing was made more forgiving in regard to character used to separate date parts. For example these strings are
  now all acceptable as `HH:mm`: `10:20`, `10 20`, `10-20`, `10/20` ([#6344](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6344))

### BUG FIXES

## 5.3.0 - 2023-03-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The CSS with predefined colors for `Button`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `SlideToggle` & `Toast` was changed to reduce file
  sizes (cuts away ~15% of the size of Grid's standalone CSS-bundles), while also making it easier for us to add more
  colors in the future
* The Grid's selection functionality has been greatly improved as of this release. In addition to row and checkbox
  selection it now also supports cell selection, column selection and `RowNumberColumn` selection. The ability to select
  by dragging the pointer has also been added. All the selection settings are now fully changeable at runtime. For full
  details of the new selection functionality, please check out or new selection demo ([#497](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/497), [#1915](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1915),
  [#3123](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3123), [#3334](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3334), [#3970](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3970), [#4628](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4628), [#4932](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4932))
* The new `FillHandle` feature brings spreadsheet like fill functionality to the Grid. When enabled, a Grid selection
  range will get a fill handle along with a fill border. This handle can then be dragged over new cells in any
  direction. The cells being dragged over will be filled with values calculated from the original selection
* The `CellEdit` feature has been updated with support for editing multiple rows simultaneously. The `multiEdit` config
  is `true` by default. Simply select multiple rows, edit the last one and then hit Ctrl+Enter to apply the new value to
  all selected rows
* The new `CellCopyPaste` feature adds the ability to cut, copy and paste individual cell values or ranges of cell
  values
* Keyboard focused column headers now has same focus indicator as cells ([#4707](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4707))
* There is a new `store` field type (`StoreDataField`) which can be used for fields on records that holds arrays. The
  array will be converted to a store, manipulating the store will flag the record as modified. On serialization the
  store will be converted back to an array
* Selection in a Grid with a `TreeStore` has been improved by addition of the `includeParents` config. Set it to `all`
  or `true` to auto select a parent if all its children gets selected. If one gets deselected, the parent will also be
  deselected. Set it to `some` to select a parent if one of its children gets selected. The parent will be deselected if
  all its children gets deselected ([#5726](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5726))
* Localization demos updated to show up-to-date localization approach
* `AjaxHelper.fetch` now supports using request body to pass parameters for non-GET requests. Please check
  `addQueryParamsToBody` argument in the method documentation ([#2855](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2855))
* New `TreeCombo` widget added
* The model relation system, a data layer concept used internally to link a `ResourceTimeRange` to a `Resource` in
  Scheduler, was made public. It allows you to define one-to-many relations between models in a `relations` block when
  subclassing `Model` ([#3222](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3222))
* The `CellCopyPaste` feature can now repeat the copied pattern into a larger selection target. Copy one cell or a range
  of cells, then select a new range of cells and paste into that. If the selected range matches the copied pattern in
  size (n times bigger, must fit completely), all the selected cells will be filled with values ([#6003](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6003))
* Lots (but not all) of the not so informative `object` types in our TypeScript typings have been replaced with more
  specific types. Objects that in our JavaScript are used as maps are now declared as `Record<keyType, valueType>`, and
  for functions that accept object arguments many are replaced with anonymous type declarations, such as
  `{ foo: string, bar: number }` (Partially fixed [#5176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5176))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] `LocaleManager.registerLocale` and `LocaleManager.extendLocale` are deprecated.
  `LocaleHelper.publishLocale` should be used instead.
* [DEPRECATED] With the introduction of cell selection, Grid's `selectionMode` config no longer has the `row` setting.
  Instead, it is the default mode and can be omitted. Specifying `cell : true` will enable cell selection and disable
  row selection - both cannot be used at the same time.
* [DEPRECATED] The `rowCheckboxSelection` setting of Grid's `selectionMode` config was renamed to `checkboxOnly`, to
  better indicate its purpose. The old name is still supported, but will be removed in a future release
* [DEPRECATED] The type of the `fields` config for `GridFieldFilterPicker` and `GridFieldFilterPickerGroup` widgets has
  changed from array of `FieldOption`s to `Object` map of `FieldOption`s keyed by field name. The array type is now
  deprecated. The fields supplied in this config (if any) will now be merged with fields found in the configured
  `grid`'s columns, instead of overwriting them

### LOCALE UPDATES

* Locales format and process for applying locales have been simplified
* New locales for 31 languages have been added. Currently available languages are listed in the localization guide
  (Guides/Customization/Localization)

## 5.2.10 - 2023-02-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Search feature now supports not showing the hit index numbers ([#6124](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6124))

### API CHANGES

* Recently browsers have added support for Unicode 15, which changes the output of `Intl.DateTimeFormat` when
  formatting time to include `AM`/`PM`. Those browsers now use "thin space" (`\u202f`) instead of regular space. This
  affects the `DateHelper.format()` function, but likely you do not need to take any action in your application. It
  also affects `DateHelper.parse()`, which has been updated to support the new unicode space ([#6193](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6193))

## 5.2.7 - 2023-01-11

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The updated `tree` demo shows using different `Model` classes for the rows ([#5888](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5888))
* `Tree` feature now supports expanding to multiple nodes ([#2287](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2287))
* `Search` feature now supports providing the "fields" to restrict the search to for performance ([#2294](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2294))

### API CHANGES

* When using remote filtering for the `AjaxStore`, the date filter value is now always serialized in the local timezone.
  Previously (but undocumented) it was using the UTC timezone. The serialization format is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ms`
  ([#5896](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5896))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5179](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5179) - Bad UX when typing into date field
* [#5253](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5253) - Moved collapsed column doesn't have red text when drop is prohibited
* [#5774](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5774) - Reordering row is not possible to do in the last row
* [#5876](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5876) - `fitMode` generates unexpected result for `ActionColumn`
* [#5883](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5883) - Unexpected error with empty columns with specific configuration

## 5.2.6 - 2022-12-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [REACT] React wrapper now supports React components in widgets and tooltips ([#774](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/774))
* The `RowCopyPaste` feature will now paste copied or cut row(s) *below* selected or provided reference record.
  Previously the documentation stated that the copied or cut row(s) would be pasted above the reference record. However,
  the behaviour was inconsistent and cut-paste was done above while copy-paste was done below ([#4890](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4890))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5019](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5019) - Grid ExtJS Modern App integration demo fails on Cell click
* [#5486](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5486) - Horizontal scrollbar overlaps when the view becomes smaller
* [#5790](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5790) - Column headers should not show pointer cursor if not sortable
* [#5805](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5805) - Visual bug with MergeCells in multipage export
* [#5812](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5812) - Horizontal scroll not working when mergeCells feature is enabled
* [#5830](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5830) - "No records to display" label is wrongly rendered
* [#5838](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5838) - Combo clearable trigger doesn't reset validation

## 5.2.5 - 2022-12-16

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* TreeStore now supports `indent` and `outdent` operations ([#5547](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5547))
* `RowCopyPaste` feature supports copying rows in a tree. Copied records will have same hierarchy
* Paste after cut and copy behavior is unified, records are moved below the paste target
* Added field `orderedParentIndex` to resolve position of the child in the ordered children array ([#5353](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5353))
* Store now applies filters/sorters to any new data when calling `applyChangeset()` ([#5534](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5534))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] Currently, when returning `undefined` from a column renderer, the actual cell will not be updated. There
  is a new config on Grid.column.Column which controls this behaviour - `alwaysClearCell`. In 5.2.5 this will default to
  `false` giving the same behaviour as previously. But in 6.0, `alwaysClearCell` will default to `true`, requiring
  columns that relies on the previous behaviour to be configured with `alwaysClearCell` set to `false`

### BUG FIXES

* [#5128](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5128) - Check column with supplied field should be filterable and sortable
* [#5267](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5267) - Copy action not copying child resources

* [#5778](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5778) - Dragging resources to the last row causes crash in group

## 5.2.4 - 2022-11-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We recently launched a new homepage over at [bryntum.com](https://bryntum.com), and have now slightly updated the
  styling for demos and docs to better match it (new logo, new header color, new font). Please note that this is not a
  change to our themes, only the look of the demos, and it won't affect your application

### BUG FIXES

* [#5594](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5594) - Grid splitter collapse/expand hover artefacts
* [#5595](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5595) - Fix panel collapse icon directions

* [#5570](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5570) - Crash when searching if focused cell is out of view

## 5.2.2 - 2022-11-08

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `emptyText` config may now be an HTML string ([#5046](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5046))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The behaviour of the `store.data` getter will be changed in 6.0. Currently, it returns the **initial**
  raw dataset, in 6.0 it will be changed to have the more expected behaviour of returning the data objects for the
  **current** state instead ([#5499](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5499))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5489](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5489) - Left region goes momentarily full width when resized to 0

### BUG FIXES

* [#4443](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4443) - `MergeCells` set `true` resources are not collapsing correctly
* [#5149](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5149) - Angular demos now use component-local styles using `ViewEncapsulation.None`
* [#5363](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5363) - Row reorder with non-direct parent/child don't match structure

* [#5480](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5480) - `EventHelper` has globally visible breaking side effects

## 5.2.0 - 2022-10-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Grid group columns now support collapsing and expanding. Try it out in the new `collapsible-columns` demo
  ([#4878](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4878))
* Grid columns can now be renamed by using the new `Rename` menu option in the column header or by focusing on the
  header and pressing `F2` ([#5112](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5112))
* Menu has a `separator` config to make it easier to visually separate menu items
* The responsive state objects used in the `responsive` config of the `Responsive` mixin now support a `once` property
  to allow configs to only be set on first activation of the state
* The `Core.helper.DateHelper` class has a new method `formatRange` method which can format date ranges, as well as new
  formatting options for week numbers
* The `TreeGroup` feature was reworked to work better in Gantt, and as a bonus it also works in Scheduler. It now
  displays a new tree structure with links to the leafs in the original structure, rather than actually restructuring
  the original store. In Grid this should have almost no impact, but for very advanced use cases it can be worth knowing
* `PdfExport` feature is refactored to render content directly. This significantly improves performance and robustness
  by eliminating component scrolling. This behavior is enabled by default. You can revert to the old behavior by setting
  `enableDirectRendering` config on the export feature to `false`. ([#4449](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4449))
* Added new `GridFieldFilterPicker` and `GridFieldFilterPickerGroup` widgets, providing UI to manage a set of
  `CollectionFilter`s based on a Grid's columns
* New `fieldfilters` demo showing how to add multi-filter UI to a Grid

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `DomHelper.up()` function was deprecated, use native `element.closest()` instead

### BUG FIXES

* [#2512](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2512) - Implement `ignoreParentReadOnly` config on Widget
* [#4907](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4907) - Export dialog is not usable on narrow screen if component has a lot of columns
* [#5237](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5237) - Moving a grouped header into another subgrid breaks headers
* [#5240](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5240) - Reordering and then collapsing columns breaks header layout
* [#5292](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5292) - Export dialog takes too much time to open in `groupedheaders` demo

* [#5360](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5360) - Clearing tree groups twice causes crash

## 5.1.5 - 2022-10-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added a preventable `beforeCancelCellEdit` event to the grid ([#1832](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1832))
* New records are assigned a generated `id` if none is provided. The generated `id` is meant to be temporary (a
  phantom `id`), and should be replaced by the backend on commit. Previously the `id` was based on a global counter
  incremented with each assignment. That simplistic scheme assured no two records got the same `id` during a session,
  but if an application serialized the generated `id` (note, they should not) and then reloaded it, it would eventually
  collide with a new generated `id`. To prevent this, the generated `id`s are now based on a random UUID instead
* Stores now by default show a warning on console when loading records that has generated `id`s, as a reminder that it
  should be replaced by the backend on commit

### BUG FIXES

* [#4645](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4645) - Improve error message "Bryntum bundle included twice"
* [#4654](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4654) - [REACT] Bryntum widget wrappers don't accept all component properties in React 18

* [#5358](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5358) - Event being triggered multiple times after changing hidden property
* [#5383](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5383) - Error triggered when adding new tab after remove a tab
* [#5384](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5384) - Error after removing tab the index is not updated

## 5.1.4 - 2022-09-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `RowReorder` feature now has a `dropOnLeaf` config which in a `TreeGrid` enables creation of parents simply by
  drag and dropping a row on a leaf. The feature has also been visually updated - when dragging and targeting into a row
  the targeted row will get a border and a different background. The arrow which previously indicated to which parent a
  row would be added, has been removed ([#4582](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4582))
* Added a preventable `beforeToggleGroup` event that is triggered before groups are toggled using the UI ([#5218](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5218))

### BUG FIXES

* [#227](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/227) - `RowReorder`: Not possible to drop a row as a child of an empty parent node

* [#5285](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5285) - Error after sorting with custom `id` model field

## 5.1.3 - 2022-09-09

### BUG FIXES

* [#415](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/415) - Improve docs on formatting currency values on `NumberField`
* [#3680](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3680) - Support Salesforce Winter 22 release
* [#5096](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5096) - `Datepicker` year select doesn't allow to configure year options
* [#5125](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5125) - Setting an initial value for `activeTab` on a `TabPanel` no longer animates that tab into view

* [#5201](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5201) - `Store` sort uses `localeCompare` for non-string types

## 5.1.2 - 2022-08-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Grid Columns now accept a `cellEditor` property as a config object to allow customization of the floating `Editor`
  Widget which encapsulates its `editor` input field ([#2465](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2465))
* An application's filters on a store may now be configured with an `internal` property. This indicates that they are
  fixed, and must not be ingested and modified by filtering UIs such as the `Filter` and   `FilterBar` features
  ([#4980](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4980))
* Configs that accept configuration options for a widget (or other class) are now (mostly) documented to accept a typed
  config object rather than a plain object. For example instead of `{Object} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`,
  it is now `{TooltipConfig} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`. This improves our TypeScript typings (transforms
  to `Partial<TooltipConfig>` in typings) when using such configs, but also improves our docs by linking to the configs
  of the type
* Added a `keepDate` config to the `TimeField`. By default, it is false and sets date component of the field value to
  `January 1st`. Set it to true to keep original value intact and only change the time component ([#5058](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5058))
* Added a new `project-summary` demo showing how to combine multiple Grid features to provide a visually nice looking
  list of data

### BUG FIXES

* [#3238](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3238) - Columns in the column store may not reflect the order they appear in visually
* [#3552](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3552) - Opened dropdown list not re-positioned when scroll the entire app
* [#4656](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4656) - Error when deleting rows out of visible area in large data sets

## 5.1.1 - 2022-07-28

### BUG FIXES

* [#4637](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4637) - `mergeCells` is not reactive to row height
* [#4798](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4798) - Grid row freezes when reordering multiple rows
* [#4979](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4979) - Some keys do not work in cell editor

## 5.1.0 - 2022-07-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* A row expander feature has been added to Grid, which also makes it available for Scheduler and Scheduler Pro. The
  feature makes it possible to expand and collapse each row by either a separate expander column or a grid cell
  event. The expanded rows content is rendered by a rendering function that the implementor provides in the feature
  config ([#2374](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2374))
* Updated the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to `6.1.1`
* Our TypeScript typings for string types that have a predefined set of alternatives was improved to only accept
  those alternatives. For example previously the `dock` config which was previously declared as `dock: string` is now
  `dock : 'top'|'right'|'bottom'|'left'`
* Create React App templates now available
* `KeyMap` is a mixin that allows for standardized and customizable keyboard shortcuts functionality. `KeyMap` is by
  default mixed in to `Widget` and therefore available to all `Widget`'s child classes. There is a new guide
  **Guides/Customization/Keyboard shortcuts** describing how to customize currently integrated keyboard shortcuts
  ([#4300](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4300), [#4313](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4313), [#4328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4328))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `breakpoints` config of the `Core.widget.mixin.Responsive` mixin is deprecated in favor of its new
  `responsive` config. The `responsive` config is more easily customized when used in the default configuration of
  widgets
* [DEPRECATED] The `responsiveWidthChange` and `responsiveHeightChange` events of the `Core.widget.mixin.Responsive`
  mixin are deprecated in favor of its new `responsiveStateChange` event
* [BREAKING] [ANGULAR] Angular wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd
  bundle. Hence application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and
  performance ([#2786](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2786))
* [BREAKING] `grid.lite.umd.js` bundle is no longer available
* [BREAKING] WebComponents has been removed from `grid.module.js` ES modules bundle. New bundle with WebComponents
  is `grid.wc.module.js`

  than a year of development. This update contains a new RadioButton widget, new TreeGroup and MergeCells features as
  well as bug fixes and other enhancements requested by our community. A big thanks to our customers who helped us with
  testing our alpha & beta versions
* You are most welcome to join us on March 16th, at 9am PST (6pm CET) for a 5.0 walkthrough webinar, demonstrating all
  the shiny new features
  [Click here to register](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/5116438317103/WN_4MkExpZPQsGYNpzh1mR_Ag)
* We hope you will enjoy this release and we are looking forward to hearing your feedback of what you would like us to
  develop next
* / Mats Bryntse, CEO @Bryntum

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Each product has a new "thin" JavaScript bundle. The thin bundle only contains product specific code, letting you
  combine multiple Bryntum products without downloading the shared code multiple times (previously only possible with
  custom-built bundles from sources). Find out more in the What's new guide ([#2805](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2805))
* Each theme is now available in a version that only has product specific CSS in it, called a `thin` version. These
  files are name `[product].[theme].thin.css` - `grid.stockholm.thin.css` for example. They are intended for using
  when you have multiple different bryntum products on the same page, to avoid including shared CSS multiple times
  Read more about it in the `What's new` section in docs ([#3276](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3276))
* Using the new `MergeCells` feature and the corresponding `mergeCells` config on columns it is now possible to have
  cells spanning multiple rows. Applies to sorted columns, cells that have the same value are merged into a single
  cell. Try it out in the new `merge-cells` demo ([#196](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/196))
* A new `deselectOnClick` config was added to `GridSelection` to allow single click toggling of a row / cell
  selected state ([#3577](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3577))
* `Model` has a new `readOnly` field that is respected by UI level editing features to disallow editing records having
  `readOnly : true`. It does not directly affect the datalayer, meaning that you can still programmatically edit the
  records ([#665](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/665))
* Grid has a new `TreeGroup` feature that can transform a tree on the fly. It generates a new tree structure based on an
  array of field names (or functions), each entry yields a new level in the resulting tree. Check it out in the new
  `tree-grouping` demo ([#3543](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3543))
* `window` references are replaced with `globalThis` which is supported in all modern browsers and across different JS
  environments ([#4071](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4071))
* A new function called `downloadTestCase()` was added to Bryntum widgets, it is intended to simplify creating test
  cases for reporting issues on Bryntum's support forum. Running it collects the current value for the configs your app
  is using, inlines the current dataset and compiles that into a JavaScript app that is then downloaded. The app will
  most likely require a fair amount of manual tweaking to reproduce the issue, but we are hoping it will simplify the
  process for you. Run `grid.downloadTestCase()` on the console in a demo to try it
* Updated FontAwesome Free to version 6, which includes some new icons sponsored by Bryntum in the charts category:
  https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&c=charts-diagrams&s=solid
* When configured with a StateProvider and `stateId`, Grid state is stored automatically as stateful properties change
  ([#1859](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1859))

  widget was added which is used in Gantt's NotesTab
* [BREAKING] TextAreaPickerField's `inline` config has been removed, use TextAreaField instead
* [BREAKING] React wrappers now use the modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd bundle. Hence
  application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and performance
  ([#2787](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2787))

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

  and `replaceChildren` API of the `TreeNode` class. Changing the column set of a Grid should use these APIs on the
  store's `rootNode`

## 4.2.5 - 2021-09-08

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `GroupSummary` feature has a new config (and property) called `target` that can be used to render summaries to
  group headers (`target : 'header'`) instead of to group footers (the default, `target : 'footer'`). Try it out in the
  updated `groupsummary` demo ([#3312](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3312))
* The API documentation now better communicates when a field or property accepts multiple input types but uses a single
  type for output. For example date fields on models, which usually accepts a `String` or `Date` but always outputs a
  `Date` ([#2933](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2933))

* [BREAKING] `Grid.util.ScrollManager` was moved to the Core package and renamed to `Core.util.ScrollManager`. It is
  untangled from the Grid and allows managing scrolling of any DOM element. ([#2883](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2883))
* Added a new `bubbleEvents` config to specify events that should always bubble. Useful for example on fields in a

## 4.1.5 - 2021-06-09

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Grid now has a `minHeight` of `10em` by default. This assures that the Grid will get a size even if no other sizing
  rules are applied for the element it is rendered to. When the default `minHeight` is driving the height, a warning is
  shown on the console to let the dev know that sizing rules are missing. The warning is not shown if a `minHeight` is
  explicitly configured ([#2915](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2915))

## 4.1.0 - 2021-04-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We are happy to announce that Bryntum Grid now can be directly installed using our npm registry
  We've updated all our frameworks demos to use `@bryntum` npm packages. See them in `examples/frameworks` folder
  Please refer to "Npm packages" guide in docs for registry login and usage information
* Added new Vue 3 Simple demo to show how to use Bryntum Grid in Vue 3 ([#13155](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/13155) - Implement demos with VUE 3
  support)
* Added new Vue Cell Renderer demo to show Vue Components as cell renderers (Partially fixed [#946](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/946) - Vue: Support
  components in renderers)
* Added new Bryntum Grid Big Dataset demo in React 17 demo . The example also implements theme switching ([#1823](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1823)
  and [#2213](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2213))
* Bryntum demos were updated with XSS protection code. `StringHelper.encodeHtml` and `StringHelper.xss` functions were
  used for this
* CellEdit#startEditing will now cancel any ongoing editing before starting the editing (previously just ignored this
  situation)
* Model fields can now be marked with `alwaysWrite` to ensure important data fields are always included when updates
  are committed by an AjaxStore ([#848](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/848))
* Refactored `TabPanel` base class to `Panel` from `Container`. The `Panel` class's algorithm for handling docked
  items (such as `tbar` and `bbar`) was enhanced to work with the new `tabBar` config of `TabPanel` using the new
  `strips` config. The `strips` config is like `tools` except it is designed for toolbars. The items in `strips`
  have a `dock` config to specify the edge to which they dock (`'top'`, `'left'`, `'bottom'`, or `'right'`) or,
  alternatively, `'header'` or `'pre-header'` to position the toolbar in the panel's header after or before the
  title, respectively. These items also use their `weight` config to determine their docking order. The higher the
  item's `weight`, the closer it will be to the panel's central body element ([#1837](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1837))
* Refactored the tab strip of `TabPanel` into a `TabBar` widget that extends `Toolbar`. This uses the new `tabBar`
  config of `TabPanel` to add an item to the new `strips` config of `Panel`. The `tabBar` uses its `weight` config
  to order it along with `tbar` and `bbar` of the `Panel`. The `tabBar` also inherits the `overflow` feature of
  `Toolbar` ([#1827](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1827))
* Panel now has a `bodyCls` config to place CSS classes on the body element
* Summary feature now offers a `refresh` method to update summaries. See updated summary demo for sample usage
* DatePicker now supports `cellRenderer` to output custom contents into the date cells ([#2498](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2498))
* `showValue` config of PercentColumn class defaults to `false` now
* The `ColumnPicker` feature now has a new config, `createColumnsFromData` which means that data fields in the grid's
  model class are interrogated and new columns may be added from the column menu to represent those fields
* It is now possible to use automatic height for cells, see the new `autoHeight` config on `Column`. Please note that
  enabling it comes with a pretty hefty performance hit, since all the cells has to be measured in DOM. Check it out in
  the new `autoheight` demo ([#2236](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2236))
* Widgets now offer `requestFullscreen` and `exitFullscreen` methods, which ensure tooltips and other floating
  sub-widgets will be visible while in fullscreen mode
* CellEdits `cancelCellEdit()` method now includes an `event` parameter if the cancellation was triggered by a DOM event
  ([#2311](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2311))
* Column´s header text is now HTML encoded by default. Can be disabled by using the new `htmlEncodeHeaderText` config
  ([#2765](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2765))
* Added a compact mode to the FilterBar feature, that overlays the filtering fields on the headers ([#2132](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2132))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] Removed RequireJS demos and integration guides in favor of modern ES6 Modules technology ([#1963](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1963))
* [BREAKING] Angular wrapper `onGridEvents` event renamed to `onCatchAll`
* [BREAKING] Angular wrapper feature names are now suffixed with `Feature`
* [BREAKING] `init` method is no longer required in Lightning Web Components and was removed from the LWC bundle
* [DEPRECATED] React, Angular, Vue wrappers `gridInstance` property renamed to `instance`
* [DEPRECATED] The `cellSelector` param of the Grid cellClick / cellDblClick / cellContextMenu / cellMouseOver /
  cellMouseOut events was deprecated and will be removed in 5.0
* [DEPRECATED] The `Store` `move` event's `record` property was deprecated in favor of `records`, but if the array form
  has been used, only contains the first record. This property will be removed in a future version
* Internal DOM structure of the DatePicker header was refactored and simplified. This may affect your styling if you
  have relied on the presence of certain elements or CSS classes
* DatePicker#editOnHover config was deprecated and it has no effect on the widget
* Returning `false` from an on-function now prevents the listeners for that event from being triggered
* The `Store.move()` API now accepts an array of records to move as well as a single record. The corresponding
  `Store` `move` event now has an extra `records` property referencing all records which have been moved

  names, introduced named objects for menu items, split context menu features by area of responsibility. Please check
  out the upgrade guide for details ([#128](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/128))
* ContextMenu feature has been split into CellMenu and HeaderMenu ([#8440](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/8440))
* Added "Customize context menus" and "Replace context menus" guides ([#1312](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1312))
* Added a new Grid Feature `StickyCells`. When using highly structured cell content, this allows row content identified
  by a selector to be pinned to the grid top while the row is scrolling off the top but is still visible:
  ```
    features : {
        stickyCells : {
            contentSelector : '.myClass'
        }
    }
  ```
* Field widgets now support a `hint` (and `hintHtml`) config to display non-interactive text overlaying the input
  element
* The RowReorder feature was updated to allow dragging multiple rows at once ([#1402](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1402))
* Added a `precision` config to Model fields of type `number`, to control the number of digits they hold. Input is
  rounded to the specified precision. Makes it easier to match up with a backend using floating numbers of a certain
  precision ([#1320](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1320))
* Grid now extends `Panel` instead of `Container`. This allows you to easily add toolbars to it ([#1417](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1417))
* Added XSS protection functions: `StringHelper.encodeHtml` and `StringHelper.xss`
* Added `grid.lite.umd.js` module that does not include `Promise` polyfill. This module is primarily intended to be used
  with Angular to prevent `zone.js` polyfills overwrite
* Added experimental support for Salesforce Locking Service ([#359](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/359)). The distributed bundle only supports modern
  browsers (no IE11 or non-chromium based Edge), since Salesforce drops support for these in January 1st 2021 too
* Added Lightning Web Component demo, see `examples/salesforce/src/lwc`

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] The `Core/adapter` directory has been removed. There are no Widget adapters. All Widget classes register
  themselves  with the `Widget` class, and the `Widget` class is the source of Widget `type` mapping and Widget
  registration and lookup by `id`
* [BREAKING] GridState now stores subGrid state in a new format so end users might observe their width/collapsed states
  not being restored
* [BREAKING] The `Default`, `Light` and `Dark` themes were renamed to `Classic`, `Classic-Light` and `Classic-Dark`
  This change highlights the fact that they are variations of the same theme, and that it is not the default theme
  (Stockholm is our default theme since version 2.0)
* [DEPRECATED] `ContextMenu` feature was deprecated. Instead 2 new features were introduced: `CellMenu` and `HeaderMenu`
* [DEPRECATED] `showRemoveRowInContextMenu` config was deprecated in favour of `CellMenu` configuration
* [DEPRECATED] Providing `cellMenuItems` and `headerMenuItems` column configs as an array was deprecated. It has to be a
  named object now
* [DEPRECATED] The `capitalizeFirsLetter()` and `lowerCaseFirstLetter()` functions in `StringHelper` was deprecated in
  favor of `capitalize()` and `uncapitalize()`
* [DEPRECATED] The `record` property of RowReorder events is now deprecated in favor of `records` since the feature now
  supports dragging multiple rows
* Model fields in derived classes are now merged with corresponding model fields (by name) in super classes. This allows
  serialization and other attributes to be inherited when a derived class only wants to change the `defaultValue` or
  other attribute of the field
* The `dateFormat` config for `type='date'` model fields has been simplified to `format`
* Arrow down from column header now navigates to first fully visible cell in that column, instead of the previous
  behavior of opening the column menu
* Stores `json` accessor (which returns a JSON string) and `toJSON()` function (an array of objects) was both documented
  and made public. Useful if you need access to the data of all records to serialize yourself. Output of `toJSON()` can
  be directly plugged into `store.data`, and the output of `json` can be consumed by setting the same property
* Widget reference moved from `reference` attribute to `data-reference`. Change only affects CSS selectors, JS API
  remain intact
* The following previously deprecated members/classes where removed:
  - `StateTrackingManager.getStoreById()`
  - `Store.isVisible()`
  - `Rectangle.round()`
  - `InstancePlugin.pluggedInto`
  - `Editor.allowInvalid`
  - `FlagField`
  - `Widget.visible`
  - `startCellEdit` events `grid` param
  - `cancelCellEdit` events `grid` param

  ([#799](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/799))

### API CHANGES

* To fix locale inheritance problems some Grid locale strings were moved from the `Grid` section to the `GridBase`
  section in localization files. Any custom localizations for Grid should be updated accordingly. ([#780](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/780))
* Column renderers can now request a lower height than the configured `rowHeight`. To allow this, they are now called
  with `size : { height : null }` instead of `size : { height : rowHeight }`. As before, set your desired height there
  The largest requested height for a row will be used. If none is requested it will use the configured row height
* Removed not used localizations `GridBase.serverResponseLabel`, `Tree.noTreeColumn`, `Grid.featureNotFound`,
  `Grid.invalidFeatureNameFormat`, `ColumnStore.columnTypeNotFound`,  `TemplateColumn.noTemplate`,
  `TemplateColumn.noFunction`

## 3.0.0 - 2019-12-20

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* New Ionic Themes demo which shows using and changing included themes. (#9394)
* Grids styling for its horizontally scrolling elements was updated with `overscroll-behaviour: contain auto`. This
  prevents accidental history navigation while scrolling horizontally using trackpads/on touch devices
* Grid `Column`s may be configured with a `finalizeCellEdit` method which validates cell edits in that column
  It must return `true` or `false`. It may also be an `async` function whose resolution yields `true` or `false`
* Added support for exporting the Grid to PDF and PNG. It is showcased in the new `export` demo. The feature requires a
  special export server, which you can find in the examples/_shared/server folder. You will find more instructions
  in the README.md file in the new demo. (#6268)
* Added `leadingZeroes` config option for NumberField (#7524)
* Localization. Common localizable words and phrases may now be added to a common `Object` block of properties and will
  be accessible to all classes
* Added support for named listeners ([#43](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/43))

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] (for those who build from sources): "Common" package was renamed to "Core", so all our basic classes
  should be imported from `lib/Core/`
* [BREAKING] Model no longer considers `null` as a valid id on records. It is now handled the same way as if id was
  undefined, meaning that a generated id will be assigned instead. If you use `null` as id on a record in your code,
  this change might be breaking
  We recommend to always supply an id for records from your backend, and there is a new setting on `Store` to enforce
  that. Configuring Store with `allowNoId: false` will make it throw if a record without id is loaded (#8570)
* NumberField no longer uses native stepping with the arrow keys, instead it implements its own with configurable
  behaviour. See the new `changeOnSpin` config
* DateHelpers default date format was made configurable (assign to DateHelper.defaultFormat) and changed from
  `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` to `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` to better match client expectations

### BUG FIXES

* #9434 - Tooltips are broken on Android devices
* [#14](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/14) - Record id 0 breaks Store#indexOf
* [#24](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/24) - Inconsistent record 'changes' object after update

* [#102](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/102) - Tree column not indented in exported Excel file

## 2.3.0 - 2019-11-05

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* Widget's tooltip configuration now uses a shared singleton Tooltip instance by default. Use `newInstance: true` if a
  new Tooltip instance is required for the widget (#7033)
* Added a basic Splitter widget that allows resizing sibling elements/widgets in a flexbox layout (#9138)
* Combobox is now able to filter its store using remote filter requests as the user types. See
  the `filterParamName` config. (#9256)
* DatePicker panel now has month and year selection combos which appear on hover (#9259)
* TextField class now supports adding minlength, maxlength, tabindex attributes, as well as any other HTML attribute
  through the new 'inputAttributes' config (#9296)
* Widgets may now adopt a preexisting DOM node to use as their encapsulating `element`. This reduces DOM footprint when
  widgets are being placed inside existing applications, or when used inside UI frameworks which provide a DOM node. See
  the `adopt` config option (#9414)
* `Container`s now support removal and adding and inserting of child widgets. See the API docs for `Container`
* `Container`s can now get/set values from/to all nested widgets using the new `values` property. Also added
  `Container#isValid` to check validity of all nested fields
* Adding event listeners now accepts an `expires` option which is for how many milliseconds the event listener persists
  before it is removed. This is useful for capturing potential future events which may or may not happen
* A new thinner version of Grid called `GridBase` was added. It is a Grid without default features, allowing smaller
  custom builds using for example WebPack. See the new `custom-build` demo for a possible setup (#7883)
* The Group features `groupRenderer` is now applied to all columns in a group header, allowing more control over the
  rendering (#8751)
* Column filtering using the FilterBar feature can now be done using any field through the new `filterable.filterField`
  config (#8799)
* Added new 'Paged Grid demo with php backend' that shows how to use a paged store for Grid with remote sorting and
  filtering (#9213)
* A new Column type: 'aggregate' has been added. When used in a Tree, it aggregates the value of that column's field
  from child nodes. (#9227)
* The CellEdit feature now allows a `beforeCellEditStart` to inject an input field into the
  `editor` property of the passed `editorContext` to use the specified input field to edit the cell (#9281)
* Grids checkbox selection now offers a mode `rowCheckboxSelection` where selection is only done when clicking on
  a checkbox (#9313)
* Support for disabling features at runtime has been improved, all features except Tree can now be disabled at any time
  (#8187, #9353)

### DATA LAYER CHANGES
* Added support for paged stores, remote sorting and remote filtering (#4504)
* Stores can now be configured with `syncDataOnLoad: true`, which will make them apply the difference between a new
  dataset and its existing data rather than doing a full replace. Especially useful in scenarios where `store.data` is
  bound to something that applies the entire dataset on changes, for example a React state
* Fields can be added/removed from a Model at runtime, using the new `Model.addField()` and `Model.removeField()`
  functions (#9328)
* `ColumnStore` can be configured with `autoAddField : true` to automatically add the fields used by its columns to
  Grids store
* Added new Angular 7 and Angular 8 integration examples (#9069)
* Experimental: The React wrapper has been updated to support using React components (JSX) in cell renderers and as cell
  editors. Please check out the updated React demos to see how it works, and read up on it in the updated integration
  guide (#7334, #9043, #9244)

### API CHANGES

* The behaviour of `Store#add()` in a tree store has been changed to take the `parentId` of the records being added into
  consideration. Previously all nodes added this way was appended to root, but they can now be added to any parent in
  the tree. For example `store.add({ name : 'New kid', parentId : 5 })` will add the new node to parent with id 5. To
  actually add to root, use `parentId : null` (or even better, use the TreeNode api)
* `Model.convertEmptyParentToLeaf` was changed to accept either a boolean or a config object, for control over if
  conversion happens on load or on CRUD or both (#8973)
* ResizeHelper can be configured with `dynamicHandleSize : true` to automatically shrink virtual handles from their
  configured size towards 1 to enable resizing elements that do no fit full handles
* The validation behaviour for `required` fields was slightly changed to not flag initially empty fields as invalid,
  they are instead flagged on blur or when checking validity
* [DEPRECATED] `InstancePlugin#pluggedInto` was deprecated in favour of already existing `InstancePlugin#client`
* The `Grid#selectRow()` method now accepts a single, object parameter to describe the required´selection type and
  associated actions to avoid long, unwieldy method signatures. The previous signature will be recognized until version
  3.0

### BUG FIXES

## 2.2.4 - 2019-09-09

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* New demo showing a stock list with rapid data updates every 20ms (#9171)
* Store has a new config `useRawData`. By specifying it as `true` you guarantee the data loaded is valid as is, which
  bypasses duplicate id detection, default values and field processing. This in turn gives a nice performance boost when
  loading large datasets (about 30% faster initial rendering time on the bigdataset demo with 10,000 records)
* Pressing space key in a grid column header now show the column menu (#8855)
* Added `contextMenuTriggerEvent` config for Grid to set event which triggers context menus and `triggerEvent` config
  for ContextMenu to override Grids setting for which triggers context menu (#8757)

### BUG FIXES

* #8669 - Mask loses alignment to Grid body element after scrolling
* #8797 - Records are not shown in the tree after clearing filters if they were added while the tree was filtered

  is passed as `true` or `false`
* #9137 - Previous scheduled event animation exit not canceled by initiating new animated event update
* #9155 - SubGrid region size changes after column resizing
* #9158 - Crash when reloading store if a group is collapsed
* #9178 - Checkbox column is broken after a group is collapsed/expanded

* Fields `readOnly` handling and styling was improved
* Model `fields` field definitions can now specify that a field is `readOnly: true`

### API CHANGES

* Widgets `visible` setter was deprecated, use `hidden` instead. To determine if a widget actually is visible, you can
  use `isVisible` (#8820)
* `store.isVisible` was deprecated, use `store.isAvailable` instead

### BUG FIXES

* #7736 - Text of selected item gets into the input in Combo with multiselect
* #7737 - Select input text and hit backspace removes selected items in Combo with multiselect
* #7739 - There is no place to type in Combo with multiselect
* #8351 - STYLING: Missing pressed / active state color
* #8439 - STYLING: Stockholm theme tab body html color

* #9060 - STYLING: Wrong slider label color in Material theme
* #9063 - Code editor panel not scrollable with mouse
* #9106 - Moving a record within a tree store causes its descendant records to be registered as added
* #9116 - DOCS: 'scrollable' property missing in Widget docs

## 2.2.2 - 2019-08-15

### FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

* Added two new classes which wrap file input: FileField and FilePicker. FileField is a default field without extra
  styling. FilePicker is more advanced component which looks like a common button

### API CHANGES

* Adding a child record to a parent in a tree store now triggers the same events (`beforeAdd`, `add`, `change`) no
  matter which function is used (`store.add()`, `node.appendChild()`, `node.insertChild()`)
* [BREAKING] Stores `beforeRemoveChild` event was removed. Removing child records in a tree store now triggers same
  events as when removing records in a flat store (`beforeRemove`, `remove`, `change`)

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added a new ButtonGroup container (#8013)
* Bumped built in FontAwesome to version 5.8.2
* Slider styling adjusted for Stockholm theme
* Tree parent cells styling changed to use bolder font
* Demos now have a built in code editor that allows you to edit their code (Chrome only) and CSS (#7210)
* `throttled` option added to `EventHelper.on`. For rapidly repeating events (Such as `wheel` or `scroll` or
  `mousemove`), this is the number of milliseconds to delay subsequent handler calls after first invocation which
  happens immediately
* `DateField` now has a `step` config which is a time delta by which to increment and decrement the value when forward
  and back triggers in the field UI are clicked (#8081)
* Grid cellEdit action is now preventable using `beforeCellEditStart` event (#8459)
* `Button` now has a `menu` config which specifies a menu to show when pressed. This may be an array of menu item
  configs, or a widget config. If a widget config, the `type` defaults to `menu`, but it could be any type, eg `'popup'`
(#8020)

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `widgets` config to specify child components of a `Container` has been deprecated in favour
  of `items`. The processing of `widgets` will be removed in a future version (#8375)
* [DEPRECATED] The 'grid' param in the events triggered by the CellEdit feature has been removed in favor of `source`
  param which points to the Grid instance
* TreeColumn now htmlEncodes its contents by default, just like regular Columns
* Model batch behaviour has been changed to no longer apply changes until `endBatch()` is called. Ending the batch will
  trigger the same `beforeUpdate` and `update` events as normal field changes does
* Returning `false` from the `beforeUpdate` listener or calling the new Model's `cancelBatch()` function will cancel the
  data update, rejecting the changes
* Widget querying now matches registered type, whereas previously it matched lowercase class name (#8464)

### BUG FIXES

* `Checkbox` now has preventable `beforeChange` event (#7631);
* `CheckColumn` now has preventable `beforeToggle` event (#7632);

  `validateFilter : true` (#7785)
* New Row reordering feature + demo added, disabled by default (#7490)
* Added API support for repainting a single column
* AjaxStore now offers a `headers` config to pass headers to the underlying server request

### API CHANGES

* Made the `grid.columns` property public and added docs. It is a readonly property to get the ColumnStore of the Grid
* When a store is maintaining a tree structure, it now has a `rootNode` property which is an invisible node which is at
  the root of the tree. All additions and removals to the dataset must be through the TreeNode API, *not* Store's
  add/remove API. So use a record's `appendChild`/`insertChild` and `removeChild` methods
* [BREAKING] When, in a tree Store, a parent node is expanded, the Store will fire its `add` event to signal
  the child nodes being inserted into the store's collection. When a parent node is collapsed, the Store will fire its
  `remove` event to signal that child nodes are being removed from the store's collection. If you listen for `add` or
  `remove` events, or the `change` event's `action : 'add'` or `action : 'remove'` to signify records being added to or
  removed from a dataset, the differentiator will be that there will be an `isExpand : true` or an `isCollapse : true`
  property on the event when it is due to node expand or collapse
* `CheckColumn` now fires `toggle` event after new data is set to the record
* The functions to show and hide load masks for Grid were made public and added to the documentation. Call
  `grid.maskBody('msg')` to show a load mask and `grid.unmaskBody()` to hide it
* Configuring a tooltip with `hideDelay : 0` will now hide it immediately, as opposed to earlier with a timeout of 0
  This in turn makes tooltip respect `hoverDelay` when moving mouse within the same `fromElement`, useful when
  populating cell tooltips async (#7730)
* In addition to specifying row height through data (see `GridRowModel`) we also made the `size` parameter of
  `Column#renderer()` public. Set `size.height` in a renderer to specify the desired row height. The largest collected
  height for that row will be used. Uses Grids configured `rowHeight` as the min value
* [BREAKING] TimeField's and DateField's `pickerFormat` config was removed in favour of using `format` also for the
  picker
* [BREAKING] Grid now renders it contents on `paint` instead of on `render`, to allow it to initialize correct when
  embedded in tab panels and similar. Because of this change, the `render` event was removed
* [BREAKING] `idField` config was removed from `Store`, it was not used in the codebase and did not work as intended
  The config is still available and working on `Model`, set it on your subclass (`MyModelClass.idField = 'MyId'`). If
  you really want to remap id to another field in your data without subclassing `Model` you can still do it using the
  `fields` config on `Store`: `new Store({ fields : [{ name : 'id', dataSource : 'MyId' }] });`
* [BREAKING] The `AjaxStore#exception` event no longer includes the `request` object. Instead it includes a reference to
  the fetch Response object through the `response` property
* [BREAKING] The `AjaxStore#loadChildren` event no longer includes the `request` object. Instead it includes a reference
  to the fetch Response object through the `response` property
* [BREAKING] The `response` property of the  `AjaxStore#loadChildren` event was renamed to `json`, and `response` refers
  to the fetch Response object
* [BREAKING] The `AjaxStore#afterRequest` event no longer includes the `request` object. Instead it includes a reference
  to the fetch Response object through the `response` property
* [BREAKING] The `response` property of the `AjaxStore#afterRequest` event was renamed to `json`, and `response` refers
  to the fetch Response object
* [BREAKING] The `response` property of the  `AjaxStore#load` event was renamed to `json`, and `response` refers to the
  fetch Response object
* [BREAKING] The `response` property of the  `AjaxStore#exception` event was renamed to `json`, and `response` refers to
  the fetch Response object
* [BREAKING] The AjaxStore now sends POST data as raw JSON (based on the Fetch API). To keep using the 1.x behavior
  which posts form data, set `AjaxStore#sendAsFormData` to true on your stores

  (#7294)

* Added a custom column to the `columntypes` demo

  a locale specific order (#7113)
* Store now throws an exception if trying to set data with duplicate ids (#7272)
* The context menu for headers and cells now accepts a `processCellItems`/`procesHeaderItems` function that allows
  processing of the items before the menu is shown

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Angular demo bumped to Angular 7
* Built in FontAwesome version bumped to 5.4.1, scope changed from .fa -> .b-fa to not affect icons outside of our
  widgets
* New Export to Excel demo (#6961)

### API CHANGES

* The `WidgetContainer` mixin has been removed. The `Container` subclass is the base for
  all Widgets which need to contain other Widgets
* The `Container` class now has a `layoutStyle` config which is an object-based config which
  may be used to apply CSS style properties to the `contentElement` of the `Container`
  By default, Containers use flexbox layout, so this may be eg `{flexDirection : 'column'}`
* There is a new `Panel` class which extends `Container` and offers the ability to dock
  headers (which may contain title and clickable tools) to any border. The `Panel` subclass
  is now the immediate superclass of `Popup`
* `Popup` now has a `closable` config which causes the display of a close icon, which, when clicked, invokes the close
  method (See the `closeAction` config)
* Form fields may contain multiple clickable "triggers" be configuring them with a
  `triggers` config. This is an object-based configuration which specifies each trigger
  with a CSS class for applying icon styling and a handler for executing the click action
* There is a new `TextAreaField` input field which may be used to edit multi-line data
  By default, it works in single line mode displaying the text in a read-only `input` element
  and editing the text in a dropdown upon click if an expand trigger. Configuring the field
  `inline: false` renders the field as a `textarea` element
* Grid's `selectionMode` config may now contain `checkbox : true` to indicate that a row's selected status is indicated
  by a checkbox
* The `CellEdit` plugin now has a `addNewAtEnd` config which indicates that when tabbing off the last column in the last
  row, a new row should automatically be inserted, and editing should continue in the first editable cell of the new
  row
* The `Combo` now accepts `multiSelect: true` to allow selection of multiple values from
  the dropdown. Selected values are shown in the form of "Chips" (formerly known as "Tags") in
  an inline display to the left of the input area. These Chips may be deleted either by
  tapping the close icon in them, or selecting them using keyboard action and deleting them
  using the delete key
* Date parsing and formatting previously used Moment.js internally, but in this version it has been replaced with custom
  code for performance reasons. Tokens used for formatting and parsing are similar to those used in Moment.js, in most
  cases you should not need to adjust your code at all
* `Collection`'s `includes` method now accepts a `string` or `number` to check for presence
  of the given value as an `id`
* `Combo` now accepts `items` as an object where property names are the field values, and
  the property values are the displayed text values
* The `Container` class now has a `layout` config which may describe a helper class to be used
  to render child items, and apply certain CSS classes to specify layout. The only ones implemented
  as of 1.1 are `'card'` which implements slide-in displaying of multiple child widgets,
  and `'fit'` which fits a single child widget into the `contentElement`
* The `TabPanel` class now fires a `tabchange` event when the active tab is changed
* When defining a `Model` subclass, it is no longer necessary to include the superclass's
  `fields` in any declared `fields` getter. The new class will automatically inherit the fields
  of its inheritance chain upon first instantiation. The same goes for specifying a `Model` subclass's `defaults`
* An Editor class has been introduced which is a `positioned` Container which encapsulates
  an input field for performing inline edits
* The `positioned: true` config indicates that a widget may be rendered into another
  widget's `contentEl`, but it does not participate in the layout. Rather it is absolutely
  positioned. Developers may use the `X` and `Y` configs directly, or the `showBy`
  and `alignTo` APIs
* `remove` method on a `Store` had third parameter `fromClear` documented
  It was removed fom documentation
* Grid now has a `showDirty` config which, when configured as `true`, displays a
  triangular "dirty" flag in the corner of a cell which contains a uncommitted change
