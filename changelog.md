# Bryntum Calendar version history

## 5.3.6 - 2023-05-26

### API CHANGES

* Event bar colors are set in an event element using the `--cal-event-color` CSS property, not by setting a color name
  CSS class
* All day event bars (and all event bars which are rendered using the renderData option `solidBar : true`) which do not
  have an `iconCls` may now show the default circular "bullet" icon before the text. To enable this, configure that
  mode (or the Calendar's `modeDefaults`) with `showBullet : { bar : true }`
* The `durationUnit` used in the new record when drag-creating events now matches the unit specified in the `dragUnit`
  property of the active view. The defaults have not changed, so in a `DayView`, the duration of drag-created events
  will be in `hours` and in all other views, (including the all day `CalendarRow` in a `DayView`) in `days`
  ([#6798](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6798))
* The `EventTooltip` feature may now be configured with `revealEventsInCluster : false` which means that when hovering a
  narrow event which is sharing day column width with other, overlapping events the hovered event does not expand to the
  full width ([#6410](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6410))

### LOCALE UPDATES

* `DayView` and `WeekView` may now be configured with how to snap an autoCreate pointer date to an `autoCreate.step`
  point. The `autoCreate.snapType` may be configured as `'round'` (the default), `'floor'` or `'ceil'` ([#6739](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6739))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6771](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6771) - No cell content should be shown for "other month" cells in `MonthView`
* [#6772](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6772) - Event colour source should be taken from correct resource
* [#6779](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6779) - `MonthView` events bars not conforming to `eventColor` renderer values.
* [#6781](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6781) - Remove erroneous `dayCellRenderer` docs from `AgendaView`
* [#6828](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6828) - `CalendarDrag` should not create an `AllDayZone` if the `allDayEvents` widget has been configured away

## 5.3.5 - 2023-05-11

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `ResourceFilter` widget may now be configured to also filter the `resourceStore` by configuring `filterResources`
  as `true` ([#6698](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6698))
* `DayView` and `WeekView` event renderers now accept a `bodyColor` property to the `renderData` which specifies the
  background color of the body part of the event block ([#6690](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6690))
* The `EventStore` setting `removeUnassignedEvent` now defaults to `false` for the Calendar product. This means that
  removing all assignments from an event will *not* remove it from the event store ([#6732](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6732))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6733](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6733) - Crash if calendar sidebar is destroyed while loading
* [#6744](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6744) - `DayView` `allDayEvents` should be able to be configured as expanded

## 5.3.4 - 2023-04-28

### BUG FIXES

* [#4631](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4631) - `eventDrag` not working well if data mapping used for start/end dates
* [#6588](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6588) - `ListView` bugs when asked to display arbitrary date range as opposed to range config

* [#6652](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6652) - Minified UMD bundle does not export `bryntum` namespace

## 5.3.3 - 2023-04-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [VUE-3] Added a new Vue-3 demo, "Scheduler Timeline". Demo is located in the
  `examples/frameworks/vue-3/calendar-scheduler` folder
* [VUE-3] Added a new Vue-3 demo showing binding to inline data arrays, "Scheduler Timeline Inline data". Demo is
  located in the `examples/frameworks/vue-3/calendar-scheduler-inline` folder
* `CalendarDatePicker` now offers an `eventFilter` config to match other Calendar widgets ([#6591](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6591))
* [ANGULAR] Bryntum Calendar now ships with two npm Angular wrapper packages to support different versions of Angular
  framework. Existing `@bryntum/calendar-angular` package is now designed to work with Angular 12 and newer versions,
  which use the IVY rendering engine. New `@bryntum/calendar-angular-view` package is designed to work with Angular 11
  and older versions, which use the View Engine rendering. Check Upgrading and Angular integration guides in
  documentation for more information ([#6270](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6270))
* [ANGULAR] `angular-7` demo has been upgraded to use Angular 11 and `@bryntum/calendar-angular-view` package. Demo is
  located in `examples/frameworks/angular/angular-11` folder

### BUG FIXES

* [#4516](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4516) - Calendar doesn't accept `project` instance
* [#5532](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5532) - Fix documentation of Vue 3 demo documentation
* [#6498](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6498) - Allow application intervention in event positioning within `DayView`
* [#6583](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6583) - `YearView` doesn't render recurring events which are `allDay`
* [#6612](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6612) - Duplicate tooltip renderer called
* [#6614](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6614) - + n more count incorrect when overflowing events start below the bottom of the cell
* [#6622](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6622) - `DayView` does not change date on header click

## 5.3.2 - 2023-04-04

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Elements rendered by the `TaskNonWorkingTime` feature elements now trigger `taskNonWorkingTimeClick`,
  `taskNonWorkingTimeDblClick` and `taskNonWorkingTimeContextMenu` events on the Gantt instance. ([#5679](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5679))
* There is a new `Calendar` event: `beforeAutoCreate`. This is a preventable event which fires before a UI-initiated
  create gesture is actioned. This allows a single point of validation for UI-initiated event creation ([#6472](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6472))
* ScheduleMenu is now enabled by default, allowing easier event creation using context menu on empty schedule space.

### BUG FIXES

* [#6395](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6395) - [ANGULAR] Cannot use `StateProvider` with a production build
* [#6417](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6417) - `schedule<DomEvent>` events do not bubble out of `ResourceView` to the Calendar
* [#6458](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6458) - Event dragging in Scheduler child mode does not relay onBeforeEventDrag event correctly
* [#6513](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6513) - Event tooltip should not show when double clicking event inside scheduler
* [#6514](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6514) - `ScheduleMenu` not working inside Scheduler mode
* [#6515](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6515) - Clicking `EventList` row for event who's `startDate` is before visible range changes visible range

## 5.3.1 - 2023-03-17

### API CHANGES

* Date parsing was made more forgiving in regard to character used to separate date parts. For example these strings are
  now all acceptable as `HH:mm`: `10:20`, `10 20`, `10-20`, `10/20` ([#6344](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6344))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6351](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6351) - Components do not render into containers not already in DOM
* [#6368](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6368) - `MonthView` event sorter gets order wrong

## 5.3.0 - 2023-03-02

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* CSS changes in Scheduler has cut the size of Calendar's standalone CSS-bundles roughly in half (Calendar includes
  Schedulers styling to allow using Scheduler as a mode). See Schedulers upgrade guide for more information
* Support for Time zone conversion has been added to all Bryntum scheduling products. Simply set a IANA time zone
  identifier as value for the `timeZone` config and that's it. But, since time zones is not supported natively in
  JavaScript we strongly recommend to read our Time zone guide ([#1533](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1533))
* Localization demos updated to show up-to-date localization approach
* New `TimeRanges` feature, that shades time ranges and displays a header in the gutter of day and week views. Try it
  out in the new `timeranges` demo ([#5113](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5113))
* `AjaxHelper.fetch` now supports using request body to pass parameters for non-GET requests. Please check
  `addQueryParamsToBody` argument in the method documentation ([#2855](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2855))
* We have added support for `resourceTimeRanges` to be added to a project. These are rendered only into subviews of a
  `ResourceView` which have matching resource ids ([#5835](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5835))
* `DayView` and `WeekView` have a new `sixMinuteTicks` config. When set to true, the time axis is subdivided into six
  minute ticks instead of the default five minute ticks ([#5645](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5645))
* Lots (but not all) of the not so informative `object` types in our TypeScript typings have been replaced with more
  specific types. Objects that in our JavaScript are used as maps are now declared as `Record<keyType, valueType>`, and
  for functions that accept object arguments many are replaced with anonymous type declarations, such as
  `{ foo: string, bar: number }` (Partially fixed [#5176](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5176))
* `YearView` and the Calendar's `datePicker` may now show more than 4 dots when `showEvents` is `'dots'` by setting
  the `maxDots` config on the `year` mode or the `datePicker` config. Note that increasing this value may produce a
  cluttered UI ([#6238](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6238))
* `YearView` and the Calendar's `datePicker` may now be configured with `eventCountTip : true` which causes a tooltip
  to appear to display the event count for the day when a cell is hovered

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] `LocaleManager.registerLocale` and `LocaleManager.extendLocale` are deprecated.
  `LocaleHelper.publishLocale` should be used instead.
* `DayView`'s `hourHeightBreakpoints` now accepts an array of heights instead of an object. The object form is still
  supported, but might get deprecated in the future

### LOCALE UPDATES

* Locales format and process for applying locales have been simplified
* New locales for 31 languages have been added. Currently available languages are listed in the localization guide
  (Guides/Customization/Localization)

### BUG FIXES

* [#4764](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4764) - Calendar `multiEventSelect` not working
* [#5988](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5988) - Calendar timezone demo UTC time incorrect
* [#6225](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6225) - Calendar collapses and expands event on each subsequent click or double click
* [#6255](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6255) - `EventTooltip` Placement Issue for Overlapping Events

## 5.2.10 - 2023-02-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Added support for adding different core hours times for each day ([#6043](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6043))

### API CHANGES

* Recently browsers have added support for Unicode 15, which changes the output of `Intl.DateTimeFormat` when
  formatting time to include `AM`/`PM`. Those browsers now use "thin space" (`\u202f`) instead of regular space. This
  affects the `DateHelper.format()` function, but likely you do not need to take any action in your application. It
  also affects `DateHelper.parse()`, which has been updated to support the new unicode space ([#6193](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6193))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5791](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5791) - `EventHelper`'s listeners for `.b-using-keyboard` break iOS dragging
* [#6177](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6177) - `EventSelection`'s `isEventSelectable` not called by Calendar's `EventSelection` mixin

## 5.2.9 - 2023-01-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The event editor of the `EventEdit` feature may be reconfigured to not be a popup by configuring the  `editorConfig`
  with `floating : false` or by adding an `appendTo` config. In this situation, the editor is displayed as a side-docked
  overlay. See the new docked-editor example. ([#5873](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5873))

### BUG FIXES

* [#6019](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/6019) - [TypeScript] Feature classes and configs have `on` event handlers exposed on owner class

## 5.2.8 - 2023-01-19

### BUG FIXES

* [#5918](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5918) - `DatePicker`'s month field does not update when locale changed at init time
* [#5934](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5934) - Agenda view shows events in wrong year
* [#5962](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5962) - Day zoom demo slider shows value with decimals when `devicePixelRatio` is not `1`

## 5.2.7 - 2023-01-11

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Internal code improvements and bugfixes

## 5.2.6 - 2022-12-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

### BUG FIXES

* [#5789](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5789) - Determining whether an event is `interDay` must consult the view's `dayTime` to handle shifted days
* [#5821](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5821) - `constrainTo` not applied unless component is shown using `alignTo`
* [#5827](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5827) - Error when navigating to view with event starting on hidden non working day

## 5.2.5 - 2022-12-16

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `ListView` now offers a `resourceColumn` in which is displayed a read-only `ChipView` depicting the resources assigned
  to the event

### API CHANGES

* The `EventStore` `loadDateRange` event would previously only fire when a different date range of events was requested
  from the store. Not as the documentation states "when a range of events is requested". This now fires whenever a date
  range of events is requested. A `changed` flag is set in the event if the range is a new date range

### BUG FIXES

* [#3954](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3954) - Fixed dragging all-day events with `dayStartShift` in effect.
* [#4530](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4530) - `loadOnDemand` with sidebar date picker using `showEvents : true` causes an infinite loop

* [#5780](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5780) - ICS export datetime stamp is not UTC

## 5.2.4 - 2022-11-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* We recently launched a new homepage over at [bryntum.com](https://bryntum.com), and have now slightly updated the
  styling for demos and docs to better match it (new logo, new header color, new font). Please note that this is not a
  change to our themes, only the look of the demos, and it won't affect your application

### BUG FIXES

* [#2125](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2125) - Recurrence edit confirmation should not be displayed when drag creating a recurring event
* [#4220](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4220) - Fixed calendar drag create in day/week view on DST days.
* [#5595](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5595) - Fix panel collapse icon directions
* [#5606](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5606) - Calendar events duplicated in UI when events start date is changed.

## 5.2.3 - 2022-11-17

### BUG FIXES

* [#5051](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5051) - Field does not show its invalid state unless it is hovered
* [#5533](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5533) - `DayViewDragZone` moves proxy element in the wrong direction in RTL mode

## 5.2.2 - 2022-11-08

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* In `DayView`s, events with a duration such that relative to the `hourHeight`, the element is too small to contain
  wrapped text will automatically change to a compact rendition. If the `hourHeight` changes (such as by zooming), the
  rendition will be corrected as appropriate ([#1948](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1948))
* `DayView` now has a `currentTimeIndicatorRenderer` which allows a customized current time indicator to be used
  ([#4972](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4972))
* The `emptyText` config of the `agenda` mode may now be an HTML string ([#5046](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5046))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The behaviour of the `store.data` getter will be changed in 6.0. Currently, it returns the **initial**
  raw dataset, in 6.0 it will be changed to have the more expected behaviour of returning the data objects for the
  **current** state instead. See Grid's upgrade guide for more information ([#5499](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5499))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5484](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5484) - Add day of week indicator class name to Calendar cells
* [#5495](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5495) - `AgendaColumn` needs to be `autoHeight` if using a custom `eventRenderer`
* [#5528](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5528) - `dayNumberClick` and `monthNameClick` events are not firing for specific modes
* [#5536](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5536) - `allDayEvents : null` in `DayView` children of `resourceView` leaves all day rows in the timeaxes

## 5.2.1 - 2022-10-28

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `DatePicker` now fully supports two modes of `multiSelect`. Setting it to `true` means that multiple, discontinuous
  ranges may be selected. Setting it to `'range'` means that one single range of one or more consecutive dates may be
  selected. ([#5368](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5368))

### API CHANGES

* Added `includeWeekendsButton` to `Calendar` with default value of `false`. Changed text of
  button to "Weekends" from "Full". ([#5459](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5459))

### BUG FIXES

* [#5149](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5149) - Angular demos now use component-local styles using `ViewEncapsulation.None`
* [#5374](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5374) - Text cropped in calendar events
* [#5392](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5392) - Crash when clicking mode selector button in small screen in web component

* [#5455](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5455) - LTS date format does not parse seconds
* [#5460](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5460) - The duplicate event option breaks assignment of events to resources

## 5.2.0 - 2022-10-13

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Calendar `DayView` now shows all week days above the detail area ([#2899](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2899))
* Calendar responds to platform differences (via the `Responsive` mixin) and provides a significantly improved User
  Experience on small screens. This responsive behavior is also compatible with saving the calendar state In particular,
  on small screens:
* The calendar sidebar automatically switches to overlay mode
* The mode selection area switches to a menu button with radio items instead of the button group
* The calendar description text is shortened
* Improved year view layout ([#4617](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4617))
* Calendar uses a new `Calendar.widget.ModeSelector` instead of a `Core.widget.ButtonGroup` on its toolbar
* The `ModeSelector` supports a `popup` mode which, when `popup: true`, displays the available calendar modes in a
      menu instead of the regular button group. This switch is made by default on small displays via the new
      `responsive` behavior described above.
* When the active mode of the calendar supports it, the mode selector displays a `Full` button to allow the user to
      toggle between full weeks and work weeks.
* Calendar views now have a `descriptionFormat` config to simplify changing the description responsively. If a
  `descriptionRenderer` is provided, it takes precedence over the `descriptionFormat`
* Calendar added the `navigatorPlacement` config to allow the forward/backward/Today buttons to appear on the sidebar
  instead of the toolbar
* Menu has a `separator` config to make it easier to visually separate menu items
* The responsive state objects used in the `responsive` config of the `Responsive` mixin now support a `once` property
  to allow configs to only be set on first activation of the state
* The `Core.helper.DateHelper` class has a new method `formatRange` method which can format date ranges, as well as new
  formatting options for week numbers
* A new config, `emptyCellRenderer` allows `MonthView` and `CalendarRow` (The all day row in a `DayView`
  or `WeekView`) to display a clickable button in cells which contain no events. There is a new
  `emptyCellClick` event. ([#4413](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4413))

## 5.1.5 - 2022-10-12

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `DatePicker` now fully supports two modes of `multiSelect`. Setting it to `true` means
  that multiple, discontinuous ranges may be selected. Setting it to `'range'` means
  that one single range of one or more consecutive dates may be selected. ([#5368](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5368))
* New records are assigned a generated `id` if none is provided. The generated `id` is meant to be temporary (a
  phantom `id`), and should be replaced by the backend on commit. Previously the `id` was based on a global counter
  incremented with each assignment. That simplistic scheme assured no two records got the same `id` during a session,
  but if an application serialized the generated `id` (note, they should not) and then reloaded it, it would eventually
  collide with a new generated `id`. To prevent this, the generated `id`s are now based on a random UUID instead
* Stores now by default show a warning on console when loading records that has generated `id`s, as a reminder that it
  should be replaced by the backend on commit

### BUG FIXES

* [#4434](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4434) - The `EventMenu` context menu's "Delete event" option doesn't handle recurring events properly
* [#4488](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4488) - Overflowed events with custom `propagateEndDate` not marked with right arrow
* [#4645](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4645) - Improve error message "Bryntum bundle included twice"
* [#4654](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4654) - [REACT] Bryntum widget wrappers don't accept all component properties in React 18
* [#4729](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4729) - Can't clear multi-select options in combo with keyboard navigation only
* [#5333](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5333) - `syncCurrentTimeIndicator` throws an error if "today" is a hidden non working day
* [#5346](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5346) - Deleting the base of a repeating event causes exception
* [#5347](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5347) - Allow `defaultCalendar` to be explicitly configured as `null`
* [#5370](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5370) - `EventEditor` `resourceField` store cannot be reconfigured

## 5.1.4 - 2022-09-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The `showEvents` config of Calendar's sidebar `DatePicker` and Calendar's `YearView` may now be `'dots'` to show
  events as a series of event-coloured dots. Maximum of three in `YearView` and four in `DatePicker`. ([#5234](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5234))

### API CHANGES

* [DEPRECATED] The `events` config of the sidebar `DatePicker` has been renamed to `showEvents`. The `events` property
  is deprecated but will continue to work during its deprecation period

### BUG FIXES

* [#5164](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5164) - Calendar listview doesn't respect columns order when rendering
* [#5311](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5311) - Enable app to change load parameters sent by `loadOnDemand` feature
* [#5313](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5313) - Multiday event not displaying if `hideNonWorkingDays` is `true`

## 5.1.3 - 2022-09-09

## 5.1.2 - 2022-08-29

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Configs that accept configuration options for a widget (or other class) are now (mostly) documented to accept a typed
  config object rather than a plain object. For example instead of `{Object} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`,
  it is now `{TooltipConfig} tooltip - A tooltip configuration object`. This improves our TypeScript typings (transforms
  to `Partial<TooltipConfig>` in typings) when using such configs, but also improves our docs by linking to the configs
  of the type
* We added the config `offsetStartsBeforeEvents` to `AgendaView` which, when set to `false`, removes the alignment of
  the textual content of event bars when there is an arrow indicating that the event is continued from a previous
  cell ([#5044](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5044))

### BUG FIXES

* [#2124](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2124) - UI issues related to recurring events
* [#3433](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3433) - Changing `minDayWidth` of the week view makes dragged events misaligned

* [#4897](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4897) - `ResourceFilter` should continue to filter when its own `Store` is filtered
* [#4988](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4988) - `scheduleMenu` doesn't catch `resourceRecord` correctly in scheduler timeline mode
* [#5007](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5007) - `zoomOnMousewheel` zooming has to be synced between multiple `DayViews` in `ResourceView`
* [#5017](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/5017) - [TypeScript] Property type is missing in `DataFieldConfig`

### BUG FIXES

* [#4904](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4904) - `eventsPerCell` not recalculated on month change when `sixWeeks` is `false`
* [#4951](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4951) - `timeFormat` doesn't work in `resourceView`
* [#4958](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4958) - List store reload needs to reset selection if no incoming records match previous selection

## 5.1.0 - 2022-07-21

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* The new config `eventListTimeFormat` is available for views which extend `EventList` (`EventList` and
  `AgendaView`). This config specifies the format for rendering time values next to event bars ([#4375](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4375))
* Our TypeScript typings for string types that have a predefined set of alternatives was improved to only accept
  those alternatives. For example previously the `dock` config which was previously declared as `dock: string` is now
  `dock : 'top'|'right'|'bottom'|'left'`
* Create React App templates now available
* Configuring the CrudManager was made a little easier by introducing shortcuts for setting load and sync urls using the
  new `loadUrl` and `syncUrl` configs
* Updated the built-in version of FontAwesome Free to `6.1.1`
* `KeyMap` is a mixin that allows for standardized and customizable keyboard shortcuts functionality. `KeyMap` is by
  default mixed in to `Widget` and therefore available to all `Widget`'s child classes. There is a new guide
  **Guides/Customization/Keyboard shortcuts** describing how to customize currently integrated keyboard shortcuts
  ([#4300](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4300), [#4313](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4313), [#4328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4328))
* Calendar's `MonthView` has a new config : `hideOtherMonthCells` Hide day cells which are not part of
  the current displayed month
* Calendar's `MonthView` has a new config : `disableOtherMonthCells` Disable all pointer interaction
  with day cells which are not part of the current displayed month

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] [ANGULAR] Angular wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd
  bundle. Hence application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and
  performance ([#2786](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2786))
* [BREAKING] `calendar.lite.umd.js` bundle is no longer available
* [BREAKING] WebComponents has been removed from `calendar.module.js` ES modules bundle. New bundle with WebComponents
  is `calendar.wc.module.js`

### BUG FIXES

* [#4895](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4895) - [LWC] `DragCreate` in all day header throws
* [#4916](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4916) - `Fullscreen` is not working on mobile Safari

## 5.0.6 - 2022-06-20

### API CHANGES

* The `validateResponse` flag on `CrudManager` has been changed to default to `true`. When enabled, it validates
  `CrudManager` responses from the backend and outputs a message on console if the format isn't valid. This is helpful
  during the development phase, but can be turned off in production
* New Vue 2/3 wrapper config option `relayStoreEvents` (defaults to `false`). When set to `true`, the events fired by
  stores are relayed to the Bryntum Grid instance
* [REACT] New basic React demo with TypeScript. Demo located in `examples/frameworks/react/typescript/basic` folder
* [REACT] React wrappers now include TypeScript definitions ([#3378](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3378))

## 5.0.0 - 2022-02-21

* We are thrilled to announce version 5.0 of our Calendar product. This release marks a big milestone for us, after more
  than a year of development. In this version we have greatly simplified how to combine Bryntum products, and we have
  made a new combination demo with the TaskBoard to show you how. The release also includes lots of improvements to the
  other demos as well as bug fixes and enhancements requested by our community. A big thanks to our customers who
  helped us with testing our alpha & beta versions
* You are most welcome to join us on March 16th, at 9am PST (6pm CET) for a 5.0 walkthrough webinar, demonstrating all
  the shiny new features
  [Click here to register](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/5116438317103/WN_4MkExpZPQsGYNpzh1mR_Ag)
* We hope you will enjoy this release and we are looking forward to hearing your feedback of what you would like us to
  develop next

*/ Mats Bryntse, CEO @Bryntum

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* New TaskBoard + Calendar integration demo
* The `EventList` calendar view which displays a grid-based view of the `EventStore` now *merges* any
  configured `columns` with its default `columns` by matching the `field` property. On display in the
  `listview` demo ([#3500](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3500))
* Each product has a new "thin" JavaScript bundle. The thin bundle only contains product specific code, letting you
  combine multiple Bryntum products without downloading the shared code multiple times (previously only possible with
  custom-built bundles from sources). Find out more in the What's new guide ([#2805](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2805))
* Each theme is now available in a version that only has product specific CSS in it, called a `thin` version. These
  files are name `[product].[theme].thin.css` - `calendar.stockholm.thin.css` for example. They are intended for using
  when you have multiple different bryntum products on the same page, to avoid including shared CSS multiple times
  Read more about it in the `What's new` section in docs ([#3276](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3276))
* `Model` has a new `readOnly` field that is respected by UI level editing features to disallow editing records having
  `readOnly : true`. It does not directly affect the datalayer, meaning that you can still programmatically edit the
  records ([#665](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/665))
* New `ProjectModel` setters/getters for `assignments`, `dependencies`, `events`, `resources` ([#4043](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4043))
* `window` references are replaced with `globalThis` which is supported in all modern browsers and across different JS
  environments ([#4071](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4071))
* A new function called `downloadTestCase()` was added to Bryntum widgets, it is intended to simplify creating test
  cases for reporting issues on Bryntum's support forum. Running it collects the current value for the configs your app
  is using, inlines the current dataset and compiles that into a JavaScript app that is then downloaded. The app will
  most likely require a fair amount of manual tweaking to reproduce the issue, but we are hoping it will simplify the
  process for you. Run `calender.downloadTestCase()` on the console in a demo to try it
* Updated FontAwesome Free to version 6, which includes some new icons sponsored by Bryntum in the charts category:
  https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&c=charts-diagrams&s=solid

### API CHANGES

* [BREAKING] React wrappers now use the more modern module bundle by default, instead of the legacy umd bundle. Hence
  application imports must be changed to match. This will slightly improve application size and performance
  ([#2787](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2787))

## 4.3.9 - 2022-02-17

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* `Calendar` now supports `minDate` and `maxDate`, meaning that temporal navigation may never place the start date of
  any view before the `minDate`, and never place the end date of any view after the `maxDate`
* Views (and therefore an owning `Calendar`) now fire a preventable `beforeDateChange` event before temporal navigation
  so that date changes may be vetoed by application logic ([#4057](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4057))

### BUG FIXES

* [#4125](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/4125) - A tooltip and event editor shows different `endDate` for same event

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Calendar's `DayView` (and, by extension, `WeekView`) now offers the `showAllDayHeader` config. This is
  `true` by default. Configure this as `false` to *not* show all day and inter-day events spanning days in
  *header cells*, but to arrange them in the day detail part of the view, wrapping into as many columns as necessary
  ([#3771](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3771))
* Updated `filtering` Angular demo to use Angular 13 ([#3742](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3742))
* Added a config to hide eventTooltip header. Use `header : false` ([#3828](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3828))
* Added a new config to the `ResourceView`. `stableResourceOrder` is `true` by default and means that the resource child
  views will always be in the same order as the resources in the `resourceStore`. If set to
  `false`, newly added (or filtered in) child views will be appended to the combined view
* Calendar now supports the `overlaySidebar` config which means that the sidebar is collapsed and the collapse tool in
  the top toolbar toggles the sidebar between the collapsed state and an overlayed _revealed_ state. On small UIs such
  as phones, this mode is enabled by default
* Added a new config for `DayCellRenderer` widgets (`MonthView` and `CalendarRow`)
  `overflowButtonRenderer` which allows apps to customize the appearance of the "+n more" button
  ([#3867](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3867))

## 4.3.3 - 2021-11-30

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Calendar modes now support a `syncViewDate` config. It is `true` by default. This means that a Calendar's modes have
  their date automatically synced with the Calendar's date. This may be set to `false` to opt out
* The `MonthView` now has an `autoRowHeight` config which means that week rows assume the height of the events they
  contain. The `minRowHeight` config controls how small week rows may shrink and may be specified in any CSS units, but
  also *in events*. So if you use `autoRowHeight`, you can specify `minRowHeight : '3ev'` which means empty weeks may
  shrink to the height equivalent to showing three event bars.

### BUG FIXES

## 4.2.7 - 2021-10-01

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* When there are many "all day" events, and the all day row of a day or week view is expanded, the all day row now only
  grows to consume up to 50% of the Calendar's height ([#3317](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3317))

## 4.2.5 - 2021-09-08

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* When using a Scheduler as a mode in Calendar (as in the calendar-scheduler demo) there are now two new useful configs,
  `range` and `stepUnit`. They let you configure how much time the time axis spans and how large steps to take when
  clicking the previous/next buttons on the toolbar. Another enhancement for the same combination is that clicking a
  date in the mini calendar in the sidebar now scrolls that date into view ([#3328](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/3328))
* ProjectModel now fires a `dataReady` event when the engine has finished its calculations and the result has been
  written back to the records ([#2019](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2019))
* The API documentation now better communicates when a field or property accepts multiple input types but uses a single
  type for output. For example date fields on models, which usually accepts a `String` or `Date` but always outputs a
  `Date` ([#2933](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2933))
* New `examples/frameworks/webpack` demo added which shows how build a Calendar bundle from sources with Webpack
  Available for licensed Calendar version which includes sources

## 4.2.4 - 2021-08-27

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* Previous versions of Calendar used a bottom border on events to create a fake gap between them in day and week views
  With this release there is now an actual gap between events instead, whose size is determined using the
  `eventSpacing` config of the DayView ([#2613](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2613))

* We are happy to announce that Bryntum Calendar now can be directly installed using our npm registry
  We've updated all our frameworks demos to use `@bryntum` npm packages. See them in `examples/frameworks` folder
  Please refer to "Npm packages" guide in docs for registry login and usage information
* Bryntum demos were updated with XSS protection code. `StringHelper.encodeHtml` and `StringHelper.xss` functions were
  used for this
* The calendar now defaults to show current date if no `date` config is provided
* Added new React 17 demo for configuring visible hours in Calendar. The example also implements theme switching
  ([#1823](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1823) and [#2213](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2213))
* A new Calendar mode, `list` is now available which shows events as a Grid in a fixed range around the Calendar's
  current date. Range may be `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `decade`. The default range is `'month'` ([#2034](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2034))
* The Agenda mode now extends the `list` view and offers a settings button to change the range size ([#1875](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1875))
* Added `shiftNext`, `shiftPrevious`, and `shiftToNow` methods to Calendar to navigate in Calendar views ([#2343](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2343))

* Added support for `overflowClickAction : 'shrinkwrap'` which makes a click on a `+n more` indicator expand that week
  row to show all events in the week. The MonthView may then scroll vertically to show all week rows because this may
  make it overflow its available height. New API and event support. ([#1165](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1165))
* Added a new Feature `weekExpander` which offers a UI to expand MonthView week rows which contain overflowing cells
* A new feature, `print` allows the current active view to be printed. ([#1595](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1595))

  a `Scheduler`, `Gantt`, or `Calendar`), provides undo and redo functionality
* Added experimental support for Salesforce Lightning Locker Service. The distributed bundle only supports modern
  browsers (not IE11 or non-chromium based Edge), since Salesforce drops support for those on January 1st 2021 too
  ([#1822](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1822))
* Added Lightning Web Component demo, see `examples/salesforce/src/lwc`
* `calendar.umd.js` and `calendar.lite.umd.js` bundles are now compiled with up-to-date `@babel/preset-env` webpack

  enhancements for supported browsers

## 4.0.0 - 2020-10-19

### FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS

* [BREAKING] Dropped Support for Edge 18 and older. Our Edge <=18 fixes are still in place and active, but we will not
  be adding more fixes. Existing fixes will be removed in a later version
* Improved default description property of `WeekView` to display week of year in addition to month
* Added `descriptionRenderer` config to calendar view widgets to allow custom descriptions
* Calendar now ships with the same set of themes as its relatives Grid, Scheduler and Gantt: material, stockholm,
  classic, classic-light and classic-dark ([#477](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/477))
* New event `dateRangeChange` is fired before any Calendar view changes its date range. This allows
  apps to request new data from the server. Upon loading data, any new events will appear
* Added new localization demo and guide ([#1409](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1409))
* New `loadOnDemand` feature which dynamically loads the Calendar's CrudManager depending on the date
  range active in the current view
* Added a styling guide ([#1427](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1427))

* Added support to export events to ICS format with the new `TimeSpan#exportToICS` method. Demonstrated in the
  new `exporttoics` example

  used with Angular to prevent `zone.js` polyfills overwrite
* Added a new `angular-7` demo ([#1537](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1537))

### API CHANGES

* Model fields in derived classes are now merged with corresponding model fields (by name) in super classes. This allows
  serialization and other attributes to be inherited when a derived class only wants to change the `defaultValue` or
  other attribute of the field
* The `dateFormat` config for `type='date'` model fields has been simplified to `format`

### BUG FIXES

## 1.0.0 - 2020-07-17

* We are very excited to announce the 1.0 GA of the Bryntum Calendar – our super modern calendar component
  with day, week, month, year and agenda views. It is written in pure ES6+ with wrappers available for React, Vue and
  Angular. The data model and UI are both extremely flexible and can be extended to match any application data model.
  Additionally, the data model is identical to that used in the Gantt / Scheduler products so you can easily share
  project data between multiple views. The SDK contains lots of examples and API documentation to get you started
  quickly

* Added new 'recurrence' demo showing recurring events
* Added new 'filterfield' to sidebar widget
* Added new 'custom-rendering' demo showing use of the `eventRenderer` method

* [#1684](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/1684) - `EventRecords` with recurrenceRule should be mutable before they acquire an `eventStore`
